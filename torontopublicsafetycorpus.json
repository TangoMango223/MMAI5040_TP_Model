Think about where you are going and plan your route before you leave. Consider:\n\n\u2022\u00a0The time of day\n\n\u2022 When the next bus/streetcar/train is scheduled, is the route delayed or out of service?\n\n\u2022 How can you avoid walking through uninhabited or badly lit areas\n\n#### **Crime Prevention on Public Transit**\n\n**Safety Tips on the Street**\n\n* * *\n\n- Let others know where you\u2019re going and when you\u2019re expected to arrive/ return. Arrange to check in with them if possible\n\n- Know where you are going and walk with confidence\n\n- Avoid shortcuts (e.g. isolated areas/laneways/garages) and stick to well-lit/high-traffic areas to get to your destination.\n\n- Be aware of your surroundings (people, traffic and what\u2019s happening around you). If you feel uncomfortable or think that you are being targeted,\u00a0put your phone/device away and move towards an area with more people and/or a nearby escape route\n\n- STAY ALERT \u2013 LOOK UP \u2013 LOOK AROUND\n\n\n**Safety Tips While Waiting For Public Transit**\n\n* * *\n\n- Carry only what you need and have your fare ready \u2013 avoid rummaging through your purse/wallet while in public and don\u2019t keep your wallet in your back pocket\n\n- Know when the next transit vehicle is scheduled to arrive and time your arrival to minimize your wait time\n\n- Do not allow yourself to be targeted, when waiting in a transit shelter. Exit the shelter if you feel threatened or uncomfortable\n\n- Limit the use of electronic devices - this may target you\n\n\n**Safety Tips When Using Public Transit**\n\n* * *\n\n- Sit near the bus or streetcar driver, use the lead car or sit in a Designated Waiting Area (DWA) while using the subway\n\n- Be alert for people watching or following you\n\n- If someone is bothering you, change seats or alert the bus driver\n\n- Keep your personal belongings close to you (on your arm, between your feet, or on your lap). Avoid placing them under the seat where they can be easily stolen or forgotten\n\n- Remain vigilant. Thieves will often use distraction or trick you to take out your device. (For example, asking you to give them directions or the time)\n\n- Avoid using devices near the doors as it makes it easy for thieves to grab your property and run through the closing doors\n\n- At night, ask the driver to make a \u201cRequest Stop\u201d between regular bus stops\n\n\n**What You Should Know About Electronic Devices**\n\n* * *\n\n- Smartphone theft has overtaken purse theft\u00a0as a common crime type\n\n\n- Put a password lock on your device that doesn\u2019t contain any of your personal details and set the lock timer so your device locks a er a short period of inactivity\n\n- Keep a record of your device(s) unique IMEI number(s) \u2013 located on the original purchase box or you can dial **\\*#06#** on your cell to obtain\n\n- Check your IMEI number for free on [ProtectYourData.ca](http://ProtectYourData.ca) to ensure the device has not been reported lost or stolen in Canada.\n\n- Keep device software up-to-date to ensure that security features are working to their maximum capabilities\n\n- Consider installing an application that allows you to track your device (if one wasn\u2019t provided on your device)\n\n- Consider installing an application that will allow you to remove/erase data from your device remotely if lost or stolen\n\n- Watch out for \u201cshoulder surfers\u201d \u2013 people who stare over your shoulder. Treat your device as if you were entering a PIN number into a key pad when other people are around\n\n- Clear the device of all personal data when recycling/discarding your device [RecycleMyCell.ca](https://recyclemycell.ca/recycling-your-device/)\n\n\n**IF YOU ARE CONFRONTED:**\n\n* * *\n\n**DO WHATEVER YOU CAN TO PROTECT YOURSELF, BUT REMEMBER YOUR SAFETY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN PROPERTY**\n\n- Try to remember distinctive points of identification about the suspect and, if possible, write this down while it is still fresh in your memory\n\n- If someone demands your property and displays (or implies) that they have a weapon, DON\u2019T RESIST. You have a greater chance of getting hurt if you do\n\n- If someone tries to assault you, ATTRACT ATTENTION. Activate the Emergency Alarm - Yellow Stripe Alarm, scream, run - do whatever you can to get away - ONLY YOU can decide how to respond to an attack\n\n\nIf you see trouble, ask yourself what are my options - can you cross the street or go into a nearby store? If you are heading to an unfamiliar area, did you get directions prior to departing or do you have the capability to look this up while enroute?\n\n**OTHER HELPFUL TRANSIT SAFETY TIPS**\n\n* * *\n\n- Never step in front of or out from behind a transit vehicle\n\n- Do not walk across streetcar right-of-ways\n\n- Never purchase transit tickets, tokens or passes from any place other than an authorized TTC agent - they may be counterfeit\n\n- TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS - Trusting your own instincts that a situation seems \u201cwrong\u201d can be the best personal safety tool you have\n\n- Pay attention to it and don\u2019t be afraid to act on it.\u00a0A moment of embarrassment, if you are incorrect, is far less important than your overall safety\n\n\nFor further information about public transit safety, check out the [TTC website](http://ttc.ca)\n\nTo report a crime anonymously, call Crime Stoppers at: 1-800-222-8477(TIPS) or online at: [www.222tips.com](http://222tips.com)\n\nIn An Emergency: Call 9-1-1.\n\nTo report a crime to the Toronto Police that is not an emergency call\u00a0416-808-2222.\n\n## More Updates\n\n* * *\n\n[![](/media/filer_public_thumbnails/filer_public/f8/ce/f8ced020-9f7b-4059-8d7e-6220d7e9d97a/c248844b-cd1e-431c-8ff9-5bced8e3cb62.jpg__630x300_q85_crop_subsampling-2_upscale.jpg)](/crime-prevention/frauds-against-seniors/)\n\n### [Frauds Against Seniors](/crime-prevention/frauds-against-seniors/)\n\n\n\n\nScams targeting older people are now called \u201cthe crime of the 21st century\u201d, as they have become so widespread.\n\nSeniors are actively pursued by fraudsters for many reasons, including\n\n[![](/media/filer_public_thumbnails/filer_public/71/6d/716dee26-1e4b-4084-ac13-6eb78983e6f8/46c8debb-f6f6-4a4a-a985-263bb29e0726.jpg__630x300_q85_crop_subsampling-2_upscale.jpg)](/crime-prevention/identity-theft-1/)\n\n### [Identity Theft](/crime-prevention/identity-theft-1/)\n\n\n\n\nIdentity theft can happen to anyone.

The offenders look for exposed jewellery or may just assume their target is likely wearing it.\n\n### Distraction Theft\n\n**How Does The Offender Approach The Victim**\n\n* * *\n\nThe suspects generally travel as a group, in a vehicle or on foot, usually with a male, female and sometimes a toddler. This makes the suspects seem less suspicious. They may drive or walk around residential neighbourhoods, shopping malls, parks or approach you at bank machines where they will distract you by spraying you with ketchup or mustard.\n\nThey may even flatten your tire as a pretense to get you to stop your vehicle, where they will take advantage of this situation to offer \u201chelp\u201d as an excuse to get close to you and your jewellery.\n\nThe suspect then walks away leaving the victim confused, not realizing that their property has been taken.\n\n**Reduce The Risk Of Being A Victim**\n\n* * *\n\n- Avoid showy/flashy displays of jewelry\n\n- Take the safest route possible. Avoid shortcuts and deserted areas; try to keep to well lit and populated streets. Walk on the side of the street that gives you the best view\n\n- Walk with a purpose and be alert/aware of your surroundings\n\n- If you are suspicious of someone and they are not leaving you alone after you have asked them to, draw attention to yourself by yelling \u201cstop following me\u201d or \u201cleave me alone\u201d\n\n- DO NOT LET THEM TOUCH YOU\n\n- If you do not feel safe or are in need of assistance, flag down a passerby, car or taxi\n\n\n### The main property targeted by distraction theft offenders is expensive jewellery. However, wallets, cell phones and purse contents are also vulnerable to this type of theft.\n\n**If You Are A Victim Or Witness of Distraction Theft**\n\n* * *\n\nIf you realize that you have been a victim or witness of distraction theft and the suspect is still there or in sight, for your safety, DO NOT CHASE OR FOLLOW THE SUSPECT.\n\n- Call 9-1-1, the Police emergency number, immediately. The faster the Police are able to respond, the better the chances the suspect(s) will be arrested\n\n- Try to memorize suspect(s) information including physical and clothing descriptions, especially tattoos, scars and other prominent features, and any suspect vehicle information or description. This is very important information when the Police arrive and the suspects are no longer on scene\n\n- Keep records of your valuables and take photos. Note all serial numbers, the quality/value, engravings and distinguishing markings. Keep that information in a safe place at home. This information can help the Police identify and recover your property\n\n- If your valuables do not have serial numbers, consider \u2018marking\u2019 your property in a unique way with a Trace Identified pen\n\n\n**Crime Prevention Tips**\n\n* * *\n\n- If you are wearing expensive jewellery, ensure that it is properly affixed and not easily removed\n\n- If possible, conceal your jewellery under clothing\n\n- Be wary of strangers who do not respect your personal space or touch you in any way\n\n- If someone is close enough to put a necklace on you, THEY ARE TOO CLOSE!\n\n- Walk with a friend whenever possible\n\n- Be aware of who is around you and report any suspicious or criminal incident immediately to the Police or anonymously to Crime Stoppers\n\n\n**Suspect Description: (only record what you remember)**\n\n* * *\n\n- **M /\u00a0 F:**\n- **Ethnicity:**\n- **Age:**\n- **Height:**\n- **Build:**\n- **Weight:**\n- **Clothing Description: (ie: shoes, pants, shirt, jacket, hat)**\n- **Additional: (jewelery, tattoos, scars, complexion, deformalities)**\n- **Face: (ie: wrinkles, ear size, nose shape, eye size and colour, eyebrow shape)**\n- **Vehicle: (make, model, plate, colour, damage)**\n- **What was said?

This rapidly growing crime affects more people every day in Toronto and around the world.\n\nYet, surprisingly most people think it will not happen to them. Reasons for this increase include the proliferation of card-skimming devices and the hacking of computers.\n\n### **What Is Identity Theft?**\n\nSomeone takes possession of your credit card information, drivers licence, birth certificate, social insurance number, bank account or other personal information for the purpose of taking advantage of your credit rating. Once an identity has been stolen, the thieves begin to deplete your finances, leaving you to deal with the financial, legal and psychological costs.\n\n**How Do These Thieves Obtain Your Identity?**\n\n* * *\n\n- Shoulder surfing at automatic teller machines \u2013 thieves see Personal Identification Numbers (PIN), credit card numbers and/or passwords\n\n- Dumpster diving, recycling containers and see through garbage bags:\u00a0thieves rifle through trash looking for loan applications, credit card documents, financial documents and other personal information\n\n- Theft of personal property such as wallets, purses and private information contained in motor vehicles\n\n- Hacking of Computers: hackers gain access to computers targeting financial information or expose you to spyware\n\n- \"Phishing\"\u00a0occurs when a\u00a0fraudster sends you an email disguised as being sent from a bank, company or organization such as Revenue Canada for the purpose of enticing you to click on a link to update\u00a0your financial information\n\n- Buying Information from dishonest employees working for financial institutions or companies that process financial information. This includes workers at retail stores or medical offices. Stolen records are passed on or sold through chat rooms or instant-messaging sessions. Some companies have had their security breached compromising your personal information\n\n- Mail Boxes: removing your mail or having it redirected to another address or box. Thieves look for new credit cards, pre-approved credit offers, insurance statements, tax information, investment documents and benefit documents\n\n- Searching Public Sources such as newspapers (obituaries), phone books,online notices and records open to the public\n\n\n**Signs That Your Personal info Has Been Compromised!**\n\n* * *\n\n- A collection agency informs you they are collecting on an account in your name you never applied for in person\n\n- You no longer receive all your mail including credit card statements\n\n- You receive letters and/or telephone calls informing you that you\u2019ve been approved for credit products you never applied for in person\n\n\n**Guard Your Personal Information and Documents**\n\n* * *\n\nIf any key documents i.e. driver\u2019s licence, social insurance card, birth certificate, passport, bank or credit card are lost or stolen \u2013 notify the issuer IMMEDIATELY. Do not delay as the thief will attempt to use the information before it is reported stolen or lost.\n\n- Shred sensitive personal documents before disposing of them\n\n- Shield the entry of your PIN and never give it to anyone else. Choose a PIN that is not easy to figure out. Do not use your birthdate, phone number or a sequence of numbers and never write down your PINs and carry it in your wallet or in your cell phone. Store these\u00a0somewhere safe\n\n- Secure your mailbox, lock it if possible. Check your credit card statement when it arrives/investigate if it\u2019s late. Arrange to have a person you trust pick up your mail if you are travelling or go to the Post Office and ask for them to hold mail service\n\n- Carry only documents\u00a0you absolutely need. Only carry your birth certificate, passport and social insurance number card when needed\n\n- Photocopy your credit cards\u00a0back and front. This will help you if you need to alert the company should they be lost or stolen\n\n\n**Guard Your Personal Information On The Computer**\n\n* * *\n\n- Protect your computer with a start-up password only you know. Never use weak or obvious passwords such a 1-2-3-4-5-6, your birthdate or the word \u201cpassword.\u201d\u00a0Do not use automatic login features that save your username and password\n\n- Phishing \u2013 be on guard for phishing scams by means of phone or internet in which thieves falsely claim to be representatives of legitimate enterprises. This includes:\n  - thieves claiming to represent Microsoft or \u201cWindows\u201d and want your computer\u2019s password to fix an alleged problem, or\n\n  - emails that appear to be from a financial institution, Revenue Canada, eBay etc. notifying you of a security breach\n\n- NEVER click on links they provide to update your information\n\n- Pharmers \u2013 simply redirect as many internet users as possible from legitimate commercial websites and lead them to malicious sites that look legitimate. This is done by an embedded link,\u00a0which claims to bring you to a secure site. When users enter their login name and password,criminals can capture this information\n\n\n**Signs That Your Personal info Has Been Compromised!**\n\n* * *\n\n- A collection agency informs you they are collecting on an account in your name you never applied for in person\n\n- You no longer receive all your mail including credit card statements\n\n- You receive letters and/or telephone calls informing you that you\u2019ve been approved for credit products you never applied for in person\n\n\n**If You Think Your Identity Has Been Stolen**\n\n* * *\n\n- Start taking notes about what has occurred and steps you\u2019ve taken.\n\n- Contact the fraud/security department of your creditors for any accounts that have been opened or tampered with. This includes utility companies, credit card companies, banks and other lenders\n\n- Ensure a \u201cfraud alert\u201d be placed on all your files immediately\n\n- Contact the two main Canadian credit bureaus:\n  - Equifax: 1-866-828-5961\n\n  - Trans Union: 1-800-663-9980\n\n**Tips For Computer Use**\n\n* * *\n\n- Never use a public Wi-Fi network to conduct for financial transactions and always clear your browser history\n\n- Change your Wi-FI router password from the factory setting\n\n- Ensure that you use a robust firewall with the latest \u201cdefinitions\u201d for the anti-virus software and keep it updated\n\n- Never open emails from sources you don\u2019t know and appear suspicious. Delete them from your inbox\n\n- Look for secure websites that begin with **https://**\n\n- Look for an icon of a lock or an unbroken key\n\n\nTo report a crime anonymously, call Crime Stoppers at: 1-800-222-8477(TIPS) or online at: [www.222tips.com](http://222tips.com)\n\nIn An Emergency: Call 9-1-1.\n\nTo report a crime to the Toronto Police that is not an emergency call\u00a0416-808-2222.\n\n## More Updates\n\n* * *\n\n[![](/media/filer_public_thumbnails/filer_public/f8/ce/f8ced020-9f7b-4059-8d7e-6220d7e9d97a/c248844b-cd1e-431c-8ff9-5bced8e3cb62.jpg__630x300_q85_crop_subsampling-2_upscale.jpg)](/crime-prevention/frauds-against-seniors/)\n\n### [Frauds Against Seniors](/crime-prevention/frauds-against-seniors/)\n\n\n\n\nScams targeting older people are now called \u201cthe crime of the 21st century\u201d, as they have become so widespread.\n\nSeniors are actively pursued by fraudsters for many reasons, including\n\n[![](/media/filer_public_thumbnails/filer_public/ce/6d/ce6dd200-694d-4040-a674-2f7a8ee49d83/449d58f4-4168-478a-a8ab-50e01f7a4e98.jpg__630x300_q85_crop_subsampling-2_upscale.jpg)](/crime-prevention/are-you-in-an-abusive-relationship/)\n\n### [Are You in an Abusive Relationship?](/crime-prevention/are-you-in-an-abusive-relationship/)\n\n\n\n\nHealthy relationships are based on love, trust and respect for each other.

Approach the job with a mature and responsible attitude. Every babysitting assignment should be carefully planned to ensure the safety and well-being of both you and the children you are responsible for while babysitting.\n\n### Babysitting Safety Starts With You\n\n**Getting Started**\n\n* * *\n\n**1\\. Enroll and complete:**\n\n- a First Aid/CPR course\n- a babysitting course which is available to young people over 11 years of age\n\n**2\\. Do NOT:**\n\n- \u00a0advertise on bulletin boards as it may solicit unwelcome responses\n- accept a job if you don\u2019t know the person calling -\u00a0ask who recommended you and check back. If in doubt, refuse\n\n3\\. Be businesslike and clearly state the days you are available, hours you may work, experience you have had and pay you consider fair.\n\n4\\.

You can minimize your risk by practicing the personal safety and crime prevention strategies outlined below.\n\n### Always Let Them Know if Someone's Home\n\nSince most residential break and enters happen during the day time when the homeowner is not home, it is important to realize that there is little chance of you encountering a burglar provided you do not do anything to hide the fact that you are home if someone knocks on your door. It is therefore important that you respond to all door knocks by speaking through a locked door unless you recognize the person. This includes training your children to safely respond to the door knock by having them let you know that someone is there or speaking through a locked door advising the person that you are busy. In the event that someone acts suspiciously \u2013 this includes asking for someone who doesn\u2019t live there \u2013 call Police.\n\n## Home Safety Starts With You\n\n**Detection in Your Neighbourhood**\n\n* * *\n\n- Keep your ears and eyes open for suspicious vehicles and people around your home\n- Do not confront possible suspects\n- Record the license plate numbers and description of suspicious vehicles\n- Record detailed descriptions of occupants of suspicious vehicles\n- Report your concerns and observations immediately to the Police\n\n**Reducing Your Risk**\n\n* * *\n\n- \u00a0Mark your property with a Trace Identified pen (www.traceidentifiedcom) or a unique identifier. This may discourage theft of valuables and will provide an easy way to identify stolen property\n- Record the contents of your home or cottage (including serial number) on paper or make a video recording and download it to a safe and easily retrieved place that is unlikely to be lost or stolen\n- Consider installing a home security system\n- Do not announce your absence on an answering machine or through social media (e.g. Facebook).\n- Check identification of sales and service people. Use the phone number in the phone book or on the website, not a number the person at the door provides\n- Don\u2019t hide keys in secret places. Instead leave a duplicate with a friend or trusted neighbour\n\n**If a Crime Has Occurred**\n\n* * *\n\n- Emergency Services (9-1-1) should be called if there is a crime in progress or an immediate threat to the safety of persons or property.\n- If you arrive at your home and suspect there has been a break-in do NOT enter - the criminal may still be inside.\n- Go immediately to a neighbour and call the Police.\n- Do NOT touch anything or clean up until the Police have inspected for evidence. \u2022 Note the license number of any suspicious vehicle\n\n**Protecting Your Home**\n\n* * *\n\n- Make sure exterior doors are solid core wood or metal\n- Install a good quality deadbolt lock on the door and a minimum four-hole security strike plate on your door frame. Use screws that are a minimum two inches in length, and longer where possible, so that they penetrate the main (unseen) structure that supports the door frame\n- Secure sliding glass doors with commercially available bars or locks, or put a wooden dowel or broom handle in the door track. Burglars look for sliding glass doors because they are the easiest to open\n- Keep garage and tool shed locked. Don\u2019t give a burglar the resources to break into your home\n- Remove all obstructions in your yard that could conceal a burglar breaking into your house\n- Limit access to out of reach windows, lower roofs, second story windows and balconies. Lock up ladders and other objects that can be used as platforms whenever possible. Watch for large, overhanging tree limbs that may provide a means of access\n- Ask a trusted neighbour to use your driveway or parking space when leaving the house for extended periods\n- If you are away, make sure that your residence looks like it is occupied. Have the sidewalks shoveled, mail collected, grass cut etc. Set the lights to come on and off at different intervals\n- Make \u201cwould-be\u201d thieves visible, install motion lights or leave an exterior light on to illuminate entranceways and rear yards\n\n**Always Let Them Know If Someone\u2019s Home**\n\n* * *\n\nSince most residential break and enters happen during the day time when the homeowner is not home, it is important to realize that there is little chance of you encountering a burglar provided you do not do anything\n\nto hide the fact that you are home if someone knocks on your door.\n\nIt is therefore important that you respond to all door knocks by speaking through a locked door unless you recognize the person.

Social isolation is also a big risk factor\n\n### Fraud Prevention Starts With You\n\n**Types Of Frauds And Scams:**\n\n**Emergency or Grandparent Scam:**\n\n* * *\n\nTypically, the caller self identifies as the senior\u2019s grandchild and requests money for an unexpected financial problem such as needed car repairs from an accident, overdue rent, emergency medical expenses or to secure release from jail. The senior, in response, states the name of the grandchild, thus providing an identity for the fraudster to continue the scam. The caller stresses that their parent (your son or daughter) must not be contacted, as well as the need for absolute secrecy. They, or an accomplice posing as a lawyer or Police Officer, will complete the fraud by providing instructions as to how to transfer the money.\n\n**Romance Scam:**\n\n* * *\n\nAfter engaging in an ongoing, online conversation through a dating website, a new-found friend, who is often from another country, declares their love and wants to visit the senior. The fraudster asks for a large sum of money to cover travel costs as they state that they cannot otherwise afford the trip. A request for cash may also be made to cover medical bills for themselves or a family member or for other pressing financial needs. It is rare for the fraudster and victim to actually meet, unless this scam takes place at the local level. The fraudster continues the swindle by making repeated and pressured requests for additional monies without ever revealing their true identity or purpose.\n\n**Home Renovation Scam:**\n\n* * *\n\nAfter answering a knock at your door, a \u201cfriendly\u201d fraudster who appears knowledgeable about construction, advises that they just happen to be working in the area and is prepared to offer you a one-time special to fix your roof, driveway or chimney as they have extra materials on hand. The fraudster targets seniors whose homes may need work as they feel they can get away with charging exorbitant fees in the belief that most seniors are not aware of the true costs of repairs. The sole intention of the fraudster is to get a signature on a contract, do little, poor or no work and take as much money\n\n**Fraud Sweepstakes, Lottery or Contest Scam:**\n\n* * *\n\nSeniors are informed via text message, mail, internet or phone that they have won the lottery, sweepstakes or contest. Scammers will advise that a fee or payment is required in order for you to collect your winnings. There may also be attempts to obtain personal and/or banking information as a condition for you to receive your prize. Once this information is received, your bank account will be drained and you could also become a victim of identity theft.\n\nThe above are just a few examples of the types of scams that are out there. People are reminded to be diligent and cautious when engaging in financial transactions without personal contact.\n\n**Crime Prevention Tips**\n\n* * *\n\n- Never allow strangers to enter your home (via internet, phone or door) and take information about you and/or your assets\n\n- Do not be pressured into signing contracts\n\n- Read contracts carefully and never sign contracts with any blank lines, as someone may later add clauses that will harm you\n\n- Do not be afraid to ask for advice from a trusted person\n\n- Never give or send cash\n\n- Keep your credit card in sight when paying and confirm the card you get back is yours\n\n- Do not volunteer personal information - guard it carefully\n\n- Shred or tear up bank statements, financial records or receipts with credit card numbers on them\n\n- Protect your Personal Information Number (PIN) and Social Insurance Number (SIN) by leaving your SIN card in a safe and secure place\n\n- Carry only necessary credit and debit cards with you\n\n- Remember the age-old statements: \u201cbuyer beware\u201d, \u201cif it seems too good to be true, it probably is\u201d and \u201cyou don\u2019t get something for nothing\u201d\n\n- And remember, if in doubt, do not proceed and call the Police immediately about anything suspicious\n\n\nFrauds and scams have a major financial impact on Canadians and cause severe economic hardship. The proliferation of scams is a direct result of an increasingly larger older population, as well as the enhanced use of social media, such as social networking and dating sites which frequently attract fraudsters.\n\nTo report a crime anonymously, call Crime Stoppers at: 1-800-222-8477(TIPS) or online at: [www.222tips.com](http://222tips.com)\n\nIn An Emergency: Call 9-1-1.\n\nTo report a crime to the Toronto Police that is not an emergency call\u00a0416-808-2222.\n\n## More Updates\n\n* * *\n\n[![](/media/filer_public_thumbnails/filer_public/71/6d/716dee26-1e4b-4084-ac13-6eb78983e6f8/46c8debb-f6f6-4a4a-a985-263bb29e0726.jpg__630x300_q85_crop_subsampling-2_upscale.jpg)](/crime-prevention/identity-theft-1/)\n\n### [Identity Theft](/crime-prevention/identity-theft-1/)\n\n\n\n\nIdentity theft can happen to anyone.

Properties become targets of crime for a variety of reasons.\n\nBy practicing the strategies outlined in this pamphlet you can reduce the risk of being victimized.\n\n### Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design Concepts\n\n**1\\. Natural Surveillance**\n\n* * *\n\nA design concept directed primarily at keeping intruders under observation. The primary goal of a surveillance strategy is to facilitate observation; it may also help to create an increased perception of risk to the offender.\n\n**Natural Surveillance Test**\n\nEvaluate your natural surveillance by answering these questions:\n\n- Does landscaping or fencing obscure the view to my property from neighbouring properties?\n\n- Are there any areas around my doors or windows where a person could hide?\n\n- Are there areas of contrast or shadow around my property where intruders can loiter without being seen?\n\n\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions, your property\u2019s natural surveillance needs to be improved. To address these concerns, consider adding motion sensitive lights, reducing or pruning trees and shrubs, or altering fencing so intruders can be seen.\n\n**2\\. Natural Access Control**\n\n* * *\n\nA design concept directed primarily at decreasing crime opportunity. The primary goal of an access control strategy is to deny access to a crime target and to create a perception of risk to the offender.\n\n**Natural Access Control Test**\n\nEvaluate your natural access control by answering these questions:\n\n- Do people routinely trespass on my property and/or fence line?\n\n- Can people trespass on my property without being seen?\n\n- Do people access my property in ways other than I intended?\n\n- Do any existing access routes lack natural surveillance?\n\n\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions, your property\u2019s access control needs to be improved. To address these concerns, consider better control of undesired movements onto and within your property. Install landscaping, fencing or barriers to restrict the movement of people when entering or exiting your property.\n\nWhen selecting fencing or landscaping materials, consider the maintenance requirements and the impact that landscaping would have on your ability to see intruders trespassing on your property. Keep patio furniture and outdoor equipment away from inaccessible windows and doors.\n\n**3\\. Territorial Reinforcement**\n\n* * *\n\nA design strategy that encourages people to take ownership and/or responsibility for a space.\n\n**Territoriality Test**\n\nEvaluate your territoriality by answering the following questions:\n\n- Do strangers regularly trespass on my property?\n- Is my property being used as a shortcut?\n- Does my property have an unlived-in or unkempt appearance?\n- Are there seldom-used sections of my property where people loiter or hang out?\n\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions, your property\u2019s territoriality needs to be improved. To address these concerns, incorporate design elements that help distinguish public from private property. For businesses and residences, this can be done through well placed low fences, hedges, flower beds, signage, other markers, and regular maintenance.\n\nIt is also critically important to maintain an \u201cillusion of occupancy\u201d when you\u2019re not home. This is extremely important in deterring thieves. This can be accomplished by making sure your lawn is maintained, your driveway is shoveled and your newspapers and mail are picked up. Set your lights to go on and off when you\u2019re not at home and have someone check on your property.\n\n**Useful Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design Strategies**\n\n* * *\n\nThe following strategies can be used alone or in combination to manipulate your property for the purpose of influencing desired behaviour.\n\n- Provide clear border definition of controlled space.\n\n- Provide clearly marked transitional zones which indicate movement from public to semi-private to private space\n\n- Create gathering areas at locations with natural surveillance and access control\n\n- Re-designate the use of space to provide natural barriers to conflicting activities\n\n- Improve scheduling of space to allow for effective use(parking for night shift workers closest to the building)\n\n- Overcome distance and isolation through improved communications\n\n- Place safe activities in vulnerable areas, e.g. community garden in vacant land\n\n- Place vulnerable activities in a safe place, e.g. kindergarten play area in school courtyard\n\n- Increase the perception of natural surveillance, especially around access control points\n\n\nTo report a crime anonymously, call Crime Stoppers at: 1-800-222-8477(TIPS) or online at: [www.222tips.com](http://222tips.com)\n\nIn An Emergency: Call 9-1-1.\n\nTo report a crime to the Toronto Police that is not an emergency call\u00a0416-808-2222.\n\n## More Updates\n\n* * *\n\n[![](/media/filer_public_thumbnails/filer_public/f8/ce/f8ced020-9f7b-4059-8d7e-6220d7e9d97a/c248844b-cd1e-431c-8ff9-5bced8e3cb62.jpg__630x300_q85_crop_subsampling-2_upscale.jpg)](/crime-prevention/frauds-against-seniors/)\n\n### [Frauds Against Seniors](/crime-prevention/frauds-against-seniors/)\n\n\n\n\nScams targeting older people are now called \u201cthe crime of the 21st century\u201d, as they have become so widespread.\n\nSeniors are actively pursued by fraudsters for many reasons, including\n\n[![](/media/filer_public_thumbnails/filer_public/71/6d/716dee26-1e4b-4084-ac13-6eb78983e6f8/46c8debb-f6f6-4a4a-a985-263bb29e0726.jpg__630x300_q85_crop_subsampling-2_upscale.jpg)](/crime-prevention/identity-theft-1/)\n\n### [Identity Theft](/crime-prevention/identity-theft-1/)\n\n\n\n\nIdentity theft can happen to anyone.

The seat should be level front to back. The seat height should be adjusted to allow a slight bend at the knee when the leg is fully extended. The handlebar height should be at the same level with the seat\n- Wear brightly coloured neon/fluorescent clothing when riding during the day or night (note: wearing white has not been shown to make you more visible)\n- \u00a0Ensure you have a properly fitted helmet - as required by The Highway Traffic Act, 104 2.1, cyclists under the age of eighteen years MUST wear a helmet while riding or operating a bicycle, and the chinstrap of the helmet must be securely fastened under the chin\n- At night, wear something that reflects light, such as reflective tape or markings, or flashing lights. Remember, just because you can see a driver, it does not mean the driver can see you\n\n**Cycling Safety**\n\n* * *\n\n- Use bike lanes whenever possible. If no bike lanes are available, ride about 1 meter from the curb in a straight line; look well ahead to avoid hazards such as potholes, sewer grates, debris and people opening car doors\n- Use caution when turning a corner as most collisions happen at intersections\n- Perform a shoulder check and signal before turning or changing lanes and try to make eye contact with drivers\n\n**Theft Prevention**\n\n* * *\n\n- Register your bicycle on the internet at www.torontopolice.on.ca and retain the information found at the bottom of this form.\n- Always lock your bicycle when not in use by placing a chain or cable through both wheels and the frame attached to a stationary object. Use a proper bicycle rack whenever possible and keep your lock away from the ground.\n- For added security, take the seat with you if it is fitted with a quick release mechanism or use a second, good quality lock that is of a different design than the first one as it will generally discourage/slow down a thief.\n- Remove the bicycle rack from your vehicle when not in use. A bicycle rack on a vehicle can attract bike thieves to your home. The more expensive the bike rack, the more attractive to a thief.\n- Remove any item, such as a saddle bag that you don\u2019t want stolen when leaving the bike unattended.\n- Ensure that any quick release wheels are secured by a chain, cable or lock.\n- Keep your bike locked and out of sight when storing it at home.\n- If your bike is stolen, report it to Police immediately and include your serial number.\n\n**Additional Tips**\n\n* * *\n\n- Place your signature on a piece of paper and have it laminated -then roll it up and put it inside your handlebars or inside your seat post. This can help you identify or recover a lost/stolen bike\n- KEEP a copy of your sales receipt\n\n**Under The Law**\n\n* * *\n\n- Your bicycle must be \u201cfit for the road\u201d. Make sure your lights, horn or bell,reflective tape, brakes and other components are in good working order and comply with The Highway Traffic Act.\n- A cyclist must stop for a Police Officer and identify themselves if requested to do so according to Section 218(1) of The Highway Traffic Act. If the cyclist refuses to identify themselves, the Police Officer may arrest the cyclist until identification (name and address) is provided.\n\nTo report a crime anonymously, call Crime Stoppers at: 1-800-222-8477(TIPS) or online at: [www.222tips.com](http://222tips.com)\n\nIn An Emergency: Call 9-1-1.\n\nTo report a crime to the Toronto Police that is not an emergency call\u00a0416-808-2222.\n\n## More Updates\n\n* * *\n\n[![](/media/filer_public_thumbnails/filer_public/f8/ce/f8ced020-9f7b-4059-8d7e-6220d7e9d97a/c248844b-cd1e-431c-8ff9-5bced8e3cb62.jpg__630x300_q85_crop_subsampling-2_upscale.jpg)](/crime-prevention/frauds-against-seniors/)\n\n### [Frauds Against Seniors](/crime-prevention/frauds-against-seniors/)\n\n\n\n\nScams targeting older people are now called \u201cthe crime of the 21st century\u201d, as they have become so widespread.\n\nSeniors are actively pursued by fraudsters for many reasons, including\n\n[![](/media/filer_public_thumbnails/filer_public/71/6d/716dee26-1e4b-4084-ac13-6eb78983e6f8/46c8debb-f6f6-4a4a-a985-263bb29e0726.jpg__630x300_q85_crop_subsampling-2_upscale.jpg)](/crime-prevention/identity-theft-1/)\n\n### [Identity Theft](/crime-prevention/identity-theft-1/)\n\n\n\n\nIdentity theft can happen to anyone.

Abusive behaviour should NEVER be confused with passion or \u201clove,\u201d it is simply wrong.\n\n**Getting Out Of An Abusive Relationship**\n\n* * *\n\nIt is vital that you recognize the signs of an abusive relationship to minimize any future harm. Do NOT make excuses for the behaviour or think that you can change it-your partner needs professional help. Remove and/or end the relationship. Your well being depends on it.\n\n**What If I Am The Victim Of Intimate Partner Violence**\n\n* * *\n\nIf you are the victim of intimate partner violence, call 9-1-1. INTIMATE PARTNER\u00a0VIOLENCE IS A CRIME. It is against the law for a person to assault or threaten another person in an intimate relationship. Violence in relationships can lead to serious injury, suicide and homicide.\n\n**INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE** includes acts used to maintain power and control over a person by creating fear and isolation. Abuse can take many forms, including physical, sexual, emotional, psychological and financial.\n\n**VICTIMS ARE ABUSED** in all social, religious, racial, cultural, income and educational groups regardless of age, sex, sexual orientation, marital or relationship status.\n\nThe Toronto Police Service is committed to assisting with the prevention and reduction of intimate partner violence through intervention and education, and by holding offenders accountable for their actions. The police are required to lay charges when there are reasonable grounds to believe an offence has occurred.\n\n**Whether you\u2019re married, living together or just dating, it is important that you know and recognize the signs of an unhealthy relationship as this can lead to trouble.**\n\n* * *\n\n#### Useful Contact Numbers\n\n**SCARBOROUGH GRACE HOSPITAL**\n\n416-495-2555\n\n[www.sacc.to](http://www.sacc.to)\n\n**NEW WOMEN\u2019S COLLEGE HOSPITAL**\n\n416-323-6040\n\n[www.womenscollegehospital.ca](http://www.womenscollegehospital.ca)\n\n**BARBRA SCHLIFER CLINIC**\n\n416-323-9149\n\n[www.schliferclinic.com](http://www.schliferclinic.com)\n\n**ABRIGO CENTRE**\n\n416-534-3434 (Portuguese)\n\n[www.abrigo.ca](http://www.abrigo.ca)\n\n**ARAB COMMUNITY CENTRE**\n\n416-231-7746 (Arabic, Armenian, French, Kurdish, Somali, Urdu)\n\n[www.arabcommunitycentre.com](http://www.arabcommunitycentre.com)\n\n**CENTRE FOR SPANISH SPEAKING\u00a0PEOPLES**\n\n416-533-8545\n\n[www.cssp-cghh.org](http://www.cssp-cghh.org)\n\n**COSTI**\n\n416-244-7714 (Italian)\n\n[www.costi.org](http://www.costi.org)\n\n**FAMILY SERVICE TORONTO**\n\n416-595-9230\n\n[www.familyservicetoronto.org](http://www.familyservicetoronto.org)\n\n**JEWISH FAMILY & CHILD SERVICE**\n\n416-638-7800 (French, Hebrew, Russian, Yiddish)\n\n[www.jfandcs.com](http://www.jfandcs.com)\n\n**KOREAN CANADIAN WOMEN\u2019S ASSOCIATION**\n\n416-340-1234\n\n[www.kcwa.net](http://www.kcwa.net)\n\n**NATIVE CHILD & FAMILY SERVICES**\n\n416-969-8510 (Ojibway, other native interpretation)\n\n[www.nativechild.org](http://www.nativechild.org)\n\n**OASIS CENTRE DES FEMMES**\n\n416-591-6565 (French)\n\n[www.oasisfemmes.com](http://www.oasisfemmes.com)\n\n**POLYCULTURAL IMMIGRANT AND COMMUNITY SERVICES**\n\n416-533-9471 (Polish, Russian, Ukrainian)\n\n[www.polycultural.org](http://www.polycultural.org)\n\n**SOUTH ASIAN FAMILY SUPPORT**\n\n416-431-4847 (Bengali, Dari, Farsi, Gujarati, Hindi, Pashto, Punjabi, Tamil, Urdu.

Do not leave the responsibility for your safety and security solely in the hands of others. Reduce your risk by protecting the personal safety and crime prevention strategies outlined below.\n\n### Safety Starts With You\n\n**Helpful Safety Hints**\n\n* * *\n\n- Keep a record of your valuables, storing only what you need or regularly use in your residence\n- Identify your property by using a Trace Identified pen (www.traceidentified.com)\n- If you notice burnt out lights on the property, report them to the building superintendent or management immediately\n- Be a good neighbour - report suspicious activity to the police and advise the building Superintendent or Management. If you see a stranger carrying items out of a neighbour\u2019s unit Call\u00a09-1-1\n\n**If A Crime Has Occurred**\n\n* * *\n\n- Call 9-1-1\u00a0if there is a crime in progress or an immediate threat to the safety of people or property\n- Do NOT enter your unit if the door is opened - the criminal may still be inside. Use your cell or neighbour\u2019s phone to call the police\n- Do NOT touch anything or clean up until the police have inspected for evidence\n- Note the licence plate number of any suspicious vehicle\n- Note the description of any suspicious person(s)\n\n**Lobby Security**\n\n* * *\n\n- Watch for strangers hanging around entry vestibules\n- Do NOT buzz or let anyone you do not know follow you into the building\n- Refer them to security or the building superintendent\n- Ensure that the main outer doors remain locked at all times\n- Make sure that only your first initial and last name appear on the lobby\u00a0directory, doorbell, mailbox and phone directory.\n\n**Elevator Security**\n\n* * *\n\n- Look who is in the elevator before you enter. If someone on the elevator\u00a0makes you nervous \u2013 do NOT get on -- take the next one\n- Get\u00a0off\u00a0the elevator if someone makes you feel uncomfortable\n- Whenever possible, stand near the control panel with your back against the side wall. In the event that someone touches or bothers you, run your hand over the control panel for the purpose of depressing as many floors as possible. This will cause the elevator to stop and the doors open, which should interrupt any attack\n\n**Door Security**\n\n* * *\n\n- Always make sure that your unit or apartment lock has been re-keyed (if not a new one installed) before you move in\n- Make sure that a good quality one-inch deadbolt lock on the door and a security strike plate on the door frame has been installed, as locks with key cylinders in the doorknob can be easily forced open\n- Keep your door locked, even when taking out the garbage or doing laundry\n- NEVER ignore a door knock or open your door to strangers. Burglars will sometimes target units by knocking on doors first\n- When responding to the door knock, ask \u201cWho is it?\u201d and look through the peep hole with the door still locked. Only open the door if you know the person or are satisfied they are someone you were expecting. Otherwise say \u201cGo away! I\u2019m calling the Police\u201d\n- NEVER rely on chain locks -- they provide poor security.

Identification numbers may be altered or removed, ownership certificates forged, parts sold or the vehicle repainted\n- For transportation - Thieves will use your vehicle to get where they want to go and later abandon the vehicle. They may just drive it around to gain \u2018status\u2019 with their friends\n- To commit other crimes - Vehicles are stolen and used in other crimes such as robberies, break and enters, drug dealing or drive-by shootings\n- For vehicle cloning - Vehicles are stolen, given a fraudulent identification number and then sold to unsuspecting persons who are defrauded of their money. Fraudulent vehicles will be located and seized by the Police\n\n**How to Reduce the Risk of Vehicle Theft**\n\n* * *\n\n**When parking your vehicle:**\n\n- Never leave a vehicle parked and running when you run an errand-even for a minute\n- Always, remove the keys and take them with you\n- Park in a well-lit, attended area if possible\n- Completely close and lock doors and windows\n- Turn your wheels towards the curb to make it harder to tow\n\n**When at home:**\n\n- If you have a garage, use and lock it\n- Install a motion sensor light to light up your vehicles and garage\n- If you have a rear-wheel drive car, back into driveway\n- If you have a front-wheel drive car, park front end first\n- Always set the emergency brake\n- Don\u2019t leave the original ownership or insurance cards in the vehicle when unattended - make a photocopy of both sides of the documents to leave in your vehicle\n- Drop business cards or address labels inside doors to assist with vehicle identification\n\n**Other important tips:**\n\n- Never hide a spare key in the vehicle, thieves know where to look\n- Be aware of your surroundings and drive with your doors locked\n\n**Preventing Theft From Your Vehicle**\n\n* * *\n\n- Never leave ANYTHING on display when you leave your vehicle. This Includes purses left in the front seat when pumping gas and power chords to run and charge devices as these may attract thieves to your vehicle\n\n- Lock all parcels and shopping bags in the trunk of your vehicle\n\n- Consider an alarm \u2013 Consider installing an alarm if you regularly leave your vehicle in accessible unattended places such as parking garage or a commuter parking lot. Remember to always take anti-theft precautions, regardless of whether you have an alarm as an alarm can only be expected to improve your chances of not being a victim\n\n**Invest in Vehicle Protection if Possible**\n\n* * *\n\n- Have an Ignition Kill Switch installed \u2013 The ignition kill switch will prevent your vehicle from starting without it being turned on. As only you will know its hidden location, it is a good deterrent against thieves. In the event that you have this switch installed, contact your insurer and ask for a discount\n- Visible Steering Wheel Lock \u2013 a visual deterrent to a thief\n- Consider installing a Vehicle Tracking System\u00a0- A vehicle tracking system uses GPS technology to locate and track your vehicle\n\n**If Your Vehicle is Stolen:**\n\n* * *\n\n**Report the theft to the Police Immediately. You should be ready to report the following vehicle information:**\n\n- Year and make, model, colour(s)\n- Licence number\n- Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)\n- Serial numbers of all special equipment\n- Special markings - decals, after-market parts, dents, scratches, other damage, etc.\n\nIf your accessories are stolen, the Police will need specific information to identify these items.

It will work\u00a0 to bring about a safe Toronto that promotes and celebrates the well-being and resilience of all residents by:\n\n- expanding the definition of community safety beyond crime or policing to include well-being\n- redefining what trauma means and deepening the ability of the City and its partners to be informed by it and respond to it\n- enhancing our ability to act early and advance preventive approaches\n- developing innovative mechanisms to use multi-sector data to inform decision making and integrate investments\n- implementing an effective multi-sector governance structure that brings our critical partners into co-ordinated leadership and action\n- committing to a long-term vision of community safety and well-being and a comprehensive plan to realize it.\n\n[SafeTO ![PDF](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-pdf.svg)](https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2021/ex/bgrd/backgroundfile-168551.pdf \"PDF Document\") will drive 26 priority actions across seven strategic goals: reduce vulnerability; reduce violence; advance truth and reconciliation; promote healing and justice; invest in people; invest in neighbourhoods, and drive collaboration and accountability. It provides a roadmap for how the City and social systems that serve Torontonians, such as community services, healthcare systems, education systems, justice systems, police and businesses, can work collaboratively across different sectors and across governments to support community safety and well-being.\n\nExpand All SafeTO: A Community Safety & Well-Being Plan accordion panelsCollapse All SafeTO: A Community Safety & Well-Being Plan accordion panels\n\n## Community Safety and Policing Act\n\n[The Community Safety and Policing Act, 2019, S.O. 2019, c. 1, Sched. 1 Part XVI ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/19c01) mandates every municipality across Ontario to prepare and adopt a Community Safety and Well-being Plan by July 2021.\n\n### Legislative Requirements\n\n#### Establish a Multi-Level Advisory Committee\n\nMunicipalities will form a multi-sectoral advisory committee comprised of representation from the police service board and other local service providers in health/mental health, education, community/social services and children/youth services.\n\n#### Consultation\n\nThe Municipality will consult the advisory committee, affected communities and those that serve them on the prioritization of risk factors and to identify strategies to address them.\n\n#### Outcomes Framework\n\nThe Municipality will use relevant data to identify and prioritize risk factors that contribute to crime, victimization and community safety and well-being; and will set out measurable outcomes that the strategies are intended to produce\n\n#### Alignment with Police Service Board\n\nPolice Service Boards will implement business plans that align with and further the goals of the Municipality\u2019s CSWB Plan.\n\n#### Publish Completed Plan\n\nThe Municipality will report on and publish the CSWB plan.\n\n#### Review Plan\n\nThe plan will be revised within a four-year time frame.\n\n## Community Safety and Well-Being Planning Framework\n\nOur work leverages the Community Safety and Well-Being Planning Framework developed by the Ministry of Solicitor General in partnership with a broad range of sectors including the City. The Community Safety and Well-Being Planning Framework includes:\n\n### Social Development (Upstream)\n\n- Social development requires long-term, multi-disciplinary efforts and investments to improve the social determinants of health and thereby reduce the probability of harm and victimization. Appropriate investment in social development will experience the social benefits of addressing root causes of crime and disorder.\n\n### Prevention (Midstream)\n\n- Prevention involves proactively implementing evidence-based situational measures, policies or programs to reduce locally identified priority risks to community safety and well-being before they result in crime, victimization and/or harm.\n- Opportunities to learn from prevention efforts can advise on strategic investment in social development\n\n### Risk Intervention (Downstream)\n\n- Risk intervention involves multiple sectors working together to address and/or interrupt escalating situations where there is an elevated risk of harm\n- What is learned by mobilizing risk intervention can inform how investments and strategies are deployed in the prevention and social development areas.\n\n### Incident Response\n\n- Immediate and reactionary responses that may involve a sense of urgency in response to crime or safety.\n- Initiatives in this area alone cannot be relied upon to increase community safety and well-being.\n\n## Prioritized Challenges\n\nThe following areas have emerged from staff review of existing engagement and consultation data and reflect key principles in our approach to the SafeTO work \u2013 build on the existing community and institutional wisdom. It is important to note that, all of the prioritized challenges are interrelated and that there will be overlap in how the City responds to these areas.\n\n### Prioritized Challenge \\#1 \u2013 Community Trauma\n\n#### Rationale\n\n- Communities and neighborhoods that experience higher levels of inequities and/or experience higher levels of violence are most vulnerable to becoming traumatized. Unaddressed trauma can manifest in physical, emotional, and psychological harm creating negative impacts on community well-being, health and safety. Systemic racism and inequity are primary contributing factors of trauma.\n- There is growing evidence that the experience of trauma, multi-generational or intergenerational racial trauma, and early trauma as a result of adverse childhood experiences can cause life-long harm, poor health outcomes and in some cases perpetuate violence.\n- Community consultations amplified the need for the City to prioritize addressing trauma. Recognizing trauma as a contributing root cause and directly addressing the impact of trauma on individuals and communities through culturally responsive approaches can help facilitate recovery from the consequences and manifestations of trauma.\n\n#### Examples\n\n- Inter-generational and multi-generational trauma as a result of historic harms experienced by Indigenous peoples are often unacknowledged or unaddressed and can result in further traumatization as a result of negative interactions with government systems.\n- In recent years, Toronto has experienced attacks including the Yonge Street van attack and the Danforth shooting which resulted in mass casualties and victimization. Further, some communities experience more frequent exposure to community violence or adverse community experiences disproportionately. The compounding impact of these events can traumatize individuals and entire communities.\n- Preliminary data from the Office of the Chief Coroner for Ontario demonstrates there was a record-high number of confirmed opioid toxicity deaths in Toronto in 2020, with a total of 521 fatalities. This represents a 78 percent increase from 2019 and a 280 percent increase from 2015. There has been a notable increase in drug-related deaths since the start of the COVID-19 emergency. Substance use is often driven by trauma, and the increase in deaths has had devastating impacts on the loved ones of those lost and the frontline workers who supported them.\n\n### Prioritized Challenge \\#2 \u2013 Community Violence\n\n#### Rationale\n\n- Community violence \u2014 including gun violence, gender-based and intimate partner violence \u2014 has been on the rise in Toronto and was declared a public health issue by the Toronto Board of Health in 2019.\n- The traumatic impact of gun violence in communities is not only experienced by individuals, it is experienced by communities which can contribute to negative long-term health outcomes and can be a contributing factor to the propensity to commit violence.\n- There have been calls to strategically mobilize short-term and long-term actions in coordination with multi-sector partners, community leaders, and residents to interrupt the immediate risks of community violence and continuously work to prevent it.\n\n#### Examples\n\n- As of May 19, 2021, there have been 119 shootings in Toronto resulting in 46 injuries and 12 people losing their lives.\n- Incidents of gender-based and intimate partner violence are also increasing in Toronto, particularly through the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n### Prioritized Challenge \\#3 \u2013 Harm Reduction and Victimization\n\n#### Rationale\n\n- Experiencing both immediate and life-long harms or repeated victimization can be a risk factor of complex conditions that threaten community safety (e.g. mental health crisis, substance use, human trafficking, and hate crimes). Continued exposure to such harms can negatively impact the social determinants of health and further exacerbate the risk to equity-deserving communities.\n- Advancing policies and programs to reduce harm and victimization and further understand vulnerability will ensure individuals and communities have access to resources and supports such as victim/witness, psycho-social and other relevant supports that promote community healing while also beginning to address the root causes of these harms.\n- Vulnerability extends to instances of acquired brain injuries and developmental disabilities; the lack of understanding of these issues combined with the lack of appropriate supports presents an increased risk of engagement with the criminal justice system.\n\n#### Examples\n\n- The number of reported hate-related incidents in Toronto has increased by 51 percent in 2020 with clear calls from the community for the City to prioritize efforts to address systemic racism and inequity.\n- Mental health calls to police are occurring at a rate of approximately 85 per day, and 76 percent of all FOCUS Toronto situations respond to mental health issues.\n- Acquired and Traumatic Brain Injuries are another notable concern given their prevalence among populations experiencing homelessness; a study conducted in 2008 found that of 904 people experiencing homelessness in Toronto, 53 percent had sustained at least one traumatic brain injury.\n- In 2020, Toronto Paramedic Services responded to 3,861 suspected overdose calls, including 268 calls involving death. This is a 90 percent increase in the number of suspected overdose deaths attended by Toronto Paramedic Services. The criminalization of people who use drugs and limited access to harm reduction services, including safer supply, contributes to the increase of drug-related overdoses and death.\n\n### Prioritized Challenge \\#4 \u2013 Injustice\n\n#### Rationale\n\n- The reliance on an enforcement lens continues to perpetuate the over-representation of Indigenous, Black and equity-deserving communities in the criminal justice system. There is a lack of consistency in terms of the application of a community justice lens in the approaches that address the root causes of community safety and well-being.\n- Restorative practices are an approach to justice that focus on addressing the harm caused by crime while holding the offender responsible for their actions, through providing an opportunity for those directly affected by the crime (victims, offenders and communities) to identify and address their needs in the aftermath of a crime in a culturally specific approach.\n- Reintegration is the support given to offenders during their re-entry into society following incarceration. It can include treatment, restorative justice and suitable community-based supports or treatment.\n- There are clear calls from the community to mobilize culturally responsive restorative practices and reintegration approaches that embody cultural identity and tradition as forms of intervention within communities.\n\n#### Example\n\n- Nearly one out of every 15 young Black men in Ontario experienced jail time, compared to one out of about every 70 young white men, and incarcerated Black people were more likely to live in low-income neighbourhoods. A siloed approach to community safety that results in an over-emphasis on enforcement has been shown to perpetuate the over-representation of Indigenous, Black and equity-deserving communities in the criminal justice system.\n- Between September 2018 and October 2019, Toronto\u2019s Metro West Court\u00adhouse received approximately 306 youth cases from 23 Division and 312 from 31 Division. Taken together, 23 and 31 Divisions account for more than 40 per cent of all youth cases seen at the Metro West Courthouse.\n- Despite making up only 4.1 per cent of the population in Ontario under age 15, Indigenous children represent approximately 30 per cent of foster children.\n\n## SafeTO Goals and Priority Actions\n\nBelow is a list of the SafeTO goals and priority actions.

2022 Work Plan\n\nThe [SafeTO Implementation Plan ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](http://app.toronto.ca/tmmis/viewAgendaItemHistory.do?item=2022.EX29.2) focuses on seven goals that will be achieved through 26 actions. As part of year one, the plan will focus on building a strong foundation which includes:\n\n- The introduction of an alternative crisis support service model that is community-led, client-centred, trauma-informed and focused on reducing harm, which will be delivered through [four community pilots](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/get-involved/community/policing-reform/?accordion=community-crisis-support-service-pilots).\n- The establishment of a Toronto Office to Prevent Gun Violence, through engagement with appropriate partners, to work with the community to enhance coordination of gun violence prevention and intervention efforts.\n- Better support for victims and communities impacted by violence, by enhancing the [Community Crisis Response Program](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/public-safety-alerts/community-safety-programs/community-crisis-response-program/) and community partnerships that provide trauma-informed, culturally responsive supports.\n- The creation of a multi-sector data centre for the purpose of informing real-time policy development and service planning.\n\nThrough the implementation plan, the City will also lead inter-governmental efforts \u2014 identifying investment priorities, creating long-term partnerships focused on shared outcomes, identifying opportunities to better coordinate and align existing investments and affecting policy change \u2014 as well as engage the community through formalizing the SafeTO Advisory Table. The group will be made up of City Divisions and Agencies, and will also include multiple sectors, grass-roots groups, and community leaders representing several core issues.\n\n## Engagement\n\nFrom November 2020 to April 2021, City staff engaged in an extensive community consultation process. Engagement included population-specific, issue-specific, and geographic-based consultations as well as internal discussions with 18 City divisions, agencies and corporations.\n\nCommunity consultations were targeted to stakeholders providing services related to or directly experiencing challenges related to community safety and well-being. This was complemented by engagement with subject matter experts, residents and community thought-leaders. In total, more than 2,500 stakeholders were engaged, with written submissions also accepted.\n\nA public survey was available from March 1 to 15, 2021 that received an additional 1,500 responses. A [summary of the SafeTO consultation findings ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2021/ex/bgrd/backgroundfile-168553.pdf \"PDF Document\") is available online.\n\n## SafeTO Collaborative Analytics and Learning Environment (SCALE)\n\nThe SafeTO Collaborative Analytics and Learning Environment (SCALE) is a collaborative platform that allows the City and partners to share data, identify effective interventions, and communicate lessons to advance prevention-focused safety outcomes. SCALE\u2019s work focuses on prototyping, piloting, and scaling approaches, all grounded in responsible data use. This initiative is a crucial contributor to the ongoing enhancement of safety outcomes, engaging municipal partners like the TTC, Toronto Police Service, University of Toronto, community organizations, and federal partners like Statistics Canada.\n\nAs part of [City council\u2019s mandate](https://secure.toronto.ca/council/agenda-item.do?item=2021.EX25.4) SCALE is a priority action in the SafeTO Community Safety and Well-Being Plan to develop a comprehensive strategy to share, integrate and analyze data across multiple institutions for the purpose of informing real-time policy development and service planning.\n\nIn 2023, SCALE launched the Community Safety and Wellbeing on Transit Dashboard\u00a0[Community Safety & Wellbeing on Transit.](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/transit-community-safety-data/)\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=mex8hc3hejgi)",

They will talk with you to understand what supports you need. The TCCS works with you to find ways to respond to your mental health needs.\n\nTCCS supports people 16 years of age and older. If you are under 16, call 211 (TTY 1-888-340-1001) to be connected to youth supports.\n\n### Supports & Services\n\n- Crisis intervention: Counselling and de-escalation for you and those around you.\n- Case Management: Working with you to achieve your goals and improve the quality of your life.\n- System Navigation & Referrals: Supporting you to access other social service programs including food, shelter, health care and employment.\n- Harm reduction: Providing substance use support, supplies, and counselling.\n- Essential Living Supplies: Providing food, clothing, and hygiene supplies.\n- Traditional Indigenous Supports: Supporting those who identify as Indigenous wholistically, with access to Elders, ceremony, medicines, and culture.\n- Afrocentric Supports: Supporting those who identify as Black through culturally meaningful approaches grounded in the lived experiences of Black communities.\n\nThe TCCS [story map ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/9828-Attachment-3-Visual-Story-of-Service-User-Experiences-scaled.jpg) illustrates some experiences from people who have used the service.\n\nIf you live outside of the City of Toronto and need mental health supports, call 211, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nExpand All Toronto Community Crisis Service: What We Do accordion panelsCollapse All Toronto Community Crisis Service: What We Do accordion panels\n\n## Can I call 911 and request the TCCS?\n\nYes. 911 call takers know about TCCS and will ask callers a few questions to determine what the best response for the situation is (ex. Ambulance, Police, Fire or TCCS).\n\n## Are TCCS crisis workers police officers?\n\nNo. All TCCS staff are civilians.\n\n## Do TCCS crisis workers wear uniforms?\n\nNo. All TCCS workers will have a lanyard and an identification card showing that they work for the TCCS. Some crisis workers may wear t-shirts or other clothing with the TCCS logo, but it is not mandatory.\n\n## How is the TCCS funded?\n\nThe TCCS is completely funded by the City of Toronto.\n\n## Does the TCCS respond to homelessness?\n\nThe primary focus of the TCCS is to respond to mental health crises. We recognize some callers experiencing mental health challenges may also be experiencing shelter and housing challenges. The TCCS will work to support their immediate needs. For street outreach and housing related supports, please contact [Streets to Homes](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/housing-shelter/homeless-help/streets-to-homes-street-outreach-support-program/).\n\n## How do I get a job with the TCCS?\n\nPlease visit the [community partners\u2019 page](?preview_id=850309) for current opportunities.\n\n## Can I call 211 on behalf of someone who I think needs support?\n\nYes. The TCCS is a voluntary and consent-based service meaning we will ask the person who you think needs support if they want to work with us. If they say yes, we will support them to address their mental health needs. If they say no, we will respect their choice and let them know we are always available if they need support.\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=d5txtglevfxo)",

Gun violence reduction requires leveraging investments, tools and mandates across sectors and governments, to enhance the efforts of community partners in the areas of violence prevention, intervention, response and recovery. The City of Toronto is working with community partners and other levels of government to steward integration of actions and services across sectors using a trauma informed public health approach.\n\nThrough the implementation of SafeTO, the City\u2019s Community Safety & Well-Being Plan, the City is also expanding its definition of community safety beyond crime or reactive responses by centering the well-being of people and place and committing to a long-term, comprehensive plan and vision to make it a reality.\n\nLeveraging its role as a system leader, service provider and strategic funder, the City of Toronto will transform the City\u2019s gun violence prevention and intervention approaches to ensure system resources are intentional, practical and laser focused on gun violence reduction.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim **June 7, 2024** as **\u201cNational Day Against Gun Violence\u201d** in the City of Toronto.\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=a87cumv70zox)\n\nPCFET0NUWVBFIGh0bWw PGJvZHk PHNjcmlwdD4oZnVuY3Rpb24oKXsndXNlIHN0cmljdCc7dmFyIGY9dHlwZW9mIE9iamVjdC5kZWZpbmVQcm9wZXJ0aWVzPT0iZnVuY3Rpb24iP09iamVjdC5kZWZpbmVQcm9wZXJ0eTpmdW5jdGlvbihhLGMsYil7aWYoYT09QXJyYXkucHJvdG90eXBlfHxhPT1PYmplY3QucHJvdG90eXBlKXJldHVybiBhO2FbY109Yi52YWx1ZTtyZXR1cm4gYX07ZnVuY3Rpb24gZyhhKXthPVsib2JqZWN0Ij09dHlwZW9mIGdsb2JhbFRoaXMmJmdsb2JhbFRoaXMsYSwib2JqZWN0Ij09dHlwZW9mIHdpbmRvdyYmd2luZG93LCJvYmplY3QiPT10eXBlb2Ygc2VsZiYmc2VsZiwib2JqZWN0Ij09dHlwZW9mIGdsb2JhbCYmZ2xvYmFsXTtmb3IodmFyIGM9MDtjPGEubGVuZ3RoOysrYyl7dmFyIGI9YVtjXTtpZihiJiZiLk1hdGg9PU1hdGgpcmV0dXJuIGJ9dGhyb3cgRXJyb3IoIkNhbm5vdCBmaW5kIGdsb2JhbCBvYmplY3QiKTt9dmFyIGg9Zyh0aGlzKTsKZnVuY3Rpb24gayhhLGMpe2lmKGMpYTp7dmFyIGI9aDthPWEuc3BsaXQoIi4iKTtmb3IodmFyIGQ9MDtkPGEubGVuZ3RoLTE7ZCsrKXt2YXIgZT1hW2RdO2lmKCEoZSBpbiBiKSlicmVhayBhO2I9YltlXX1hPWFbYS5sZW5ndGgtMV07ZD1iW2FdO2M9YyhkKTtjIT1kJiZjIT1udWxsJiZmKGIsYSx7Y29uZmlndXJhYmxlOiEwLHdyaXRhYmxlOiEwLHZhbHVlOmN9KX19aygiZ2xvYmFsVGhpcyIsZnVuY3Rpb24oYSl7cmV0dXJuIGF8fGh9KTsvKgoKIENvcHlyaWdodCBHb29nbGUgTExDCiBTUERYLUxpY2Vuc2UtSWRlbnRpZmllcjogQXBhY2hlLTIuMAoqLwp2YXIgbD1nbG9iYWxUaGlzLnRydXN0ZWRUeXBlcyxtO2Z1bmN0aW9uIG4oKXt2YXIgYT1udWxsO2lmKCFsKXJldHVybiBhO3RyeXt2YXIgYz1mdW5jdGlvbihiKXtyZXR1cm4gYn07YT1sLmNyZWF0ZVBvbGljeSgiZ29vZyNodG1sIix7Y3JlYXRlSFRNTDpjLGNyZWF0ZVNjcmlwdDpjLGNyZWF0ZVNjcmlwdFVSTDpjfSl9Y2F0Y2goYil7fXJldHVybiBhfTtmdW5jdGlvbiBwKGEpe3RoaXMuZz1hfXAucHJvdG90eXBlLnRvU3RyaW5nPWZ1bmN0aW9uKCl7cmV0dXJuIHRoaXMuZysiIn07ZnVuY3Rpb24gcShhKXttPT09dm9pZCAwJiYobT1uKCkpO3JldHVybiBuZXcgcChtP20uY3JlYXRlU2NyaXB0VVJMKGEpOmEpfTtpZighZnVuY3Rpb24oKXtpZihzZWxmLm9yaWdpbilyZXR1cm4gc2VsZi5vcmlnaW49PT0ibnVsbCI7aWYobG9jYXRpb24uaG9zdCE9PSIiKXJldHVybiExO3RyeXtyZXR1cm4gd2luZG93LnBhcmVudC5lc2NhcGUoIiIpLCExfWNhdGNoKGEpe3JldHVybiEwfX0oKSl0aHJvdyBFcnJvcigic2FuZGJveGluZyBlcnJvciIpOwp3aW5kb3cuYWRkRXZlbnRMaXN0ZW5lcigibWVzc2FnZSIsZnVuY3Rpb24oYSl7dmFyIGM9YS5wb3J0c1swXTthPWEuZGF0YTt2YXIgYj1hLmNhbGxiYWNrTmFtZS5zcGxpdCgiLiIpLGQ9d2luZG93O2JbMF09PT0id2luZG93IiYmYi5zaGlmdCgpO2Zvcih2YXIgZT0wO2U8Yi5sZW5ndGgtMTtlKyspZFtiW2VdXT17fSxkPWRbYltlXV07ZFtiW2IubGVuZ3RoLTFdXT1mdW5jdGlvbihyKXtjLnBvc3RNZXNzYWdlKEpTT04uc3RyaW5naWZ5KHIpKX07Yj1kb2N1bWVudC5jcmVhdGVFbGVtZW50KCJzY3JpcHQiKTthPXEoYS51cmwpO2lmKGEgaW5zdGFuY2VvZiBwKWE9YS5nO2Vsc2UgdGhyb3cgRXJyb3IoIiIpO2Iuc3JjPWE7ZG9jdW1lbnQuYm9keS5hcHBlbmRDaGlsZChiKX0sITApO30pLmNhbGwodGhpcyk7Cjwvc2NyaXB0PjwvYm9keT4=",

This commitment requires innovation to deliver alternative or even higher levels of coordinated services.\n\nSPIDER delivers customized responses for the purpose of mitigating elevated health and safety risks that affect people, property and neighbourhoods.\n\nIt strengthens the effectiveness of City services in resolving complex situations that could not be resolved by City divisions working alone or in limited coordination with each other.\n\n## Situations SPIDER Gets Involved In\n\nSPIDER is involved in situations involving the chronic hoarding of animals, possessions and refuse; multiple property standard and fire code violations; bed bug and other pest infestations.\n\n## How SPIDER is Activated\n\nMost SPIDER situations are first brought to the attention of City services by distressed neighbours and community members \u2500 sometimes through their councillor, but most times through 3-1-1 requests.\n\nVarious City divisions and agencies are first responders to complex property and community standards issues, some of which arise as a result of a person experiencing vulnerability.\n\nStaff from the division(s) who are first to respond will take the immediate appropriate actions to remedy the circumstance at the time but if issues are known to be chronic or of elevated risk, the case will be discussed at the SPIDER Situation Table to determine the best course of action to provide resolution.\n\nSPIDER is not designed to supersede normal City services.\u00a0 It is reserved for rare and complex situations.\n\n## Definition of Vulnerability\n\nThe City of Toronto defines vulnerability as a gap between the challenges a person faces and the resources they can access when facing those challenges.\n\nVulnerability must be assessed in context \u2013 a person\u2019s vulnerability or resilience will depend on their circumstances, environment and resources in the broadest sense.\n\nThis definition of vulnerability emphasizes service and resource gaps \u2500 not characteristics of the person \u2500 as the core driver of vulnerability and affirms the role of the service provider to make extra efforts to reduce vulnerability by closing these gaps.\n\n## What to Do When You Need SPIDER in Your Community\n\nYou play an important role in ensuring the health and well-being of your family, friends and neighbours.\n\nIf you notice that there is an unsafe situation developing that may bring harm to a specific individual or the community at large (including property), do not hesitate to call 3-1-1.\n\n3-1-1 will know how to direct your call so that issues of greatest risk will be investigated first (e.g., fire code violations), and if necessary, will trigger response from other relevant divisions and/or SPIDER.\n\nIf you have an ongoing concern in your community that you feel has not been addressed and/or received the proper level of response, please contact: [SPIDER@toronto.ca](mailto:SPIDER@toronto.ca)\n\n## Partner Agencies\n\nSPIDER is a collaborative risk-driven model consisting of multiple City Divisions and Community Partners\n\n![Intervening Agencies](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/97b0-6-500x375.jpg)\n\n![Referring Agencies](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/8ff4-5-500x375.jpg)\n\n## Outcomes\n\n![SPIDER 2017](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/9076-Picture1.jpg)\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=o1os9j10g48p)",

        "markdown": "![City of Toronto](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/themes/cot/img/logo-print.svg)\n\n# Community Paramedicine Program\n\nToronto Paramedic Services\u2019 Community Paramedicine Program provides community based medical care, referrals and system navigation to seniors and vulnerable individuals through home visits, remote consultations and wellness clinics.\n\nHighly skilled and specially trained Community Paramedics (CPs) match each patient\u2019s unique needs to the most appropriate intervention, with a focus on health promotion and injury prevention. The program increases the level of support available to clients by aiding with system navigation and helps manage recurrent medical emergencies that may lead to frequent 911 use and/or Emergency Department (ED) visits.\n\nCommunity Paramedics have become an integral part of the healthcare system, identifying and addressing gaps in community-based healthcare, and have been an invaluable resource throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nToronto Paramedic Services offers the following Community Paramedicine programs for residents and visitors of the City of Toronto.\n\nExpand All Community Paramedicine Program accordion panelsCollapse All Community Paramedicine Program accordion panels\n\n## Community Referrals by Emergency Medical Services\n\nToronto Paramedic Services\u2019 Community Referrals by Emergency Medical Services (CREMS) program was established in 2006 and enables Paramedics while responding to 911 calls to identify clients that would benefit from additional support managing their healthcare at home. While on scene, Paramedics are uniquely positioned to identify additional medical and/or social needs for their patients. When needs are identified, responding Paramedics submit a referral outlining the barriers experienced by the client, based on information gathered at the time of the 911 call. Depending on the information provided, clients are either referred directly to [Ontario Health atHome ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://ontariohealthathome.ca/home-care/) or Toronto Paramedic Services\u2019 Community Paramedics for follow-up.\n\nThe Community Paramedicine program also receives referrals directly from third party sources, including local hospitals, primary care, community agencies, allied emergency services, as well as clients and caregivers. Clients can be referred using the attached Referral Form, as well as by phone, email, or fax.\n\n## Community Paramedic Led Clinic\n\nCommunity Paramedic-Led Clinics (CPLC) are operated biweekly by Community Paramedics to support seniors and other at-risk demographics. These wellness clinics are typically located in Toronto Community Housing, Toronto Seniors Housing, and shelters where Community Paramedics (CPs) provide patient assessments, vital sign checks, health education and referrals to various community programs and services.\n\nThe CPLC team performs multiple functions and primarily serves frail, vulnerable, and (in some instances) homebound residents. Clients are supported by one-on-one clinic assessments, health and wellness educational presentations, and home visiting. Clients typically have their vital signs assessed (and monitored for trends), their health-related questions answered, and referrals made for additional services (where appropriate).\n\nAt clinic locations potential clients are identified through review of recent 911 calls placed at clinic locations to Paramedic Services. CPs can reach out to the 911 caller/potential client and invite them to the biweekly clinic. Alternatively, the CP may opt to follow up later, with the goal of better supporting the individual at home.\n\n## Community Paramedic Home Visit Program\n\nCommunity Paramedics perform home visits for clients who require additional support in the community. Clients are predominantly identified through three sources:\n\n1. Paramedic referrals from emergency calls (i.e. CREMS referrals),\n2. Analysis of frequent requests for Paramedic service via 911, and\n3. Direct referrals from program partners, clients, or caregivers.\n\nThe home visit program assists vulnerable clients in Toronto through:\n\n- Advanced medical assessment, vital signs evaluation, and diagnostics\n- Identifying and addressing gaps in healthcare and social support\n- Healthcare system navigation and connecting clients to additional community supports and services\n- Working with partner agencies and primary care to support and augment existing services and programs\n- Coaching and education on various topics, including chronic disease management\n- Support with hospital discharge planning and providing outreach to clients returning home from hospital\n- Collaboration of multi-agency support via situation tables (e.g., FOCUS) and patient care conferences\n- Vaccinations for homebound individuals\n- Follow-up with frequent users of 911 and the emergency departments they attend (where appropriate)\n\nThe program provides non-emergent home visits; typically referrals are responded to within one to three business days for booking of an initial home visit. If a more urgent visit is required, partners are encouraged to call 416-397-4322 and select option one to speak to the Community Paramedicine Program directly. For medical emergencies please call 9-1-1.\n\n## Targeted Street Outreach\n\nCommunity Paramedics participate in weekly targeted street outreach with the City of Toronto\u2019s Streets-to-Homes outreach workers to provide medical and social support to clients experiencing homelessness. City outreach workers identify individuals who would benefit from a Community Paramedic assessment, and the joint Community Paramedic-outreach worker team perform targeted visits. City-wide outreach typically occurs at locations such as encampments, shelters, or areas where clients are known to be located. The partnership provides opportunity to build and maintain positive relationships and connections between clients, Paramedics, and the healthcare system.\n\nAs an extension of Toronto Public Health\u2019s \u201c [The Works ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/health-wellness-care/health-programs-advice/services-provided-by-the-works/)\u201d program, Community Paramedics provide free Naloxone (also referred to as Narcan) kits and training to clients at risk of opioid overdose, as well their family and friends. Kits are available for distribution to eligible clients across the city to help address the increasing opioid overdose crisis.\n\n## Community Paramedicine Homebound Vaccination Program\n\nToronto Paramedic Services supports homebound clients and their caregivers with in-home Influenza and COVID-19 vaccinations. Clients are primarily referred by their assigned Care Coordinator at Home and Community Care Support Services (HCCSS). Alternatively, clients who do not receive HCCSS support can be also referred through by their primary care provider or the [Toronto Seniors Helpline ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://torontoseniorshelpline.ca/).\n\nHomebound clients are defined as those experiencing medical, physical, cognitive, or psychosocial needs/conditions that inhibit them from visiting a local clinic, pharmacy, or primary care provider. Additionally, transportation and other strategies to remedy access challenges are either not available or not appropriate given the circumstances.\n\nToronto Paramedic Services has staffed targeted vaccination clinics for vulnerable individuals since 2002. Targeted clinics occur in several congregate settings, including retirement homes, subsidized housing, shelter locations, encampment sites, as well as hotspots identified by Toronto Public Health. Vaccination clinics have typically provided seasonal influenza vaccination; however, the clinics\u2019 scope was expanded in 2020 to include COVID-19 vaccines during the pandemic.\n\n**Please note this program is seasonal and runs from October to March each year.**\n\n## Community Paramedicine for Long-Term Care\n\nThe Community Paramedicine for Long-Term Care (CPLTC) program focuses on supporting clients who are eligible for or awaiting placement within a long-term care home. Community Paramedics perform home visits and remote consultations with clients to identify and investigate gaps in services. The mandate of the program is to create or enhance the clients\u2019 connections and supports while they await long-term care placement. Home visits involve a physical assessment, medical and social history gathering, vital signs acquisition, and other diagnostics required to identify and execute treatment options for clients. In addition to scheduled visits, the program responds to real-time requests for in-home support from clients, their caregivers, and community practitioners.\n\n## Complex Care Cases Program\n\nThe Complex Care Cases (CCC) program is intended to identify clients (usually children) living in the community who have medically complex care requirements. The program addresses each clients\u2019 treatment needs and hospital destination considerations. Every client is issued a specialized treatment plan (also known as an Emergency Information Sheet) which provides guidance to family members, caregivers, and first responders in the event of a medical emergency requiring a 911 response. The CCC program is a collaborative effort between Community Paramedics, Emergency Medical Dispatchers and Call Takers, Toronto Paramedic Services\u2019 Medical Director, Sunnybrook Regional Base Hospital, Home Community Care Support Services (HCCSS), the Hospital for Sick Children, and the families/caregivers of the complex clients.\n\nReferrals are received directly from either the Hospital for Sick Children Complex Care team or through the HCCSS Care Coordinator. Each referral received is thoroughly reviewed and screened for eligibility.\n\nCCC eligibility criteria includes:\n\n- Lives within the City of Toronto (\u2018M\u2019 postal code)\n- Complex treatment requirements and/or equipment that provides treatment interventions outside of the Paramedic\u2019s standard scope of practice\n- A hospital requirement that differs from conventional hospital destination protocols\n\nFor more information about this program, or to discuss eligibility and enrollment, please contact [cphome@toronto.ca ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](mailto:cphome@toronto.ca) or 416-397-4322 and select option one.\n\n### Community Paramedicine Contact Information\n\nAll inquiries or referrals for the Toronto Paramedic Services Community Paramedicine Program can be directed to:\n\n- Email: [cphome@toronto.ca ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](mailto:cphome@toronto.ca)\n- Phone: 416-397-4322, (option 1)\n- Secure Fax: 416-696-3500\n\nAll inquiries or referrals for the Toronto Paramedic Services Homebound Vaccination Program can be directed to:\n\n- Email: [homevaccination@toronto.ca ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](mailto:homevaccination@toronto.ca)\n- Phone: 416-397-4322, (option 2)\n- Secure Fax: 416-696-3500\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=12dpovz9cets)",

Community PEERS was developed in response to youth violence prevention supports requested from community stakeholders and frontline workers across Toronto.\n\nAll Peer Support Workers in Community PEERS have received a certified, 12-week Peer Support Training through [The Community Healing Project](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/public-safety-alerts/community-safety-programs/community-healing-project/), have lived experiences of community violence exposure, and practical experiences of working with youth vulnerable to involvement in serious violence and crime.\n\nAs a response to emerging healing opportunities for communities, training requests for frontline workers, and mental health/safety needs of communities and young people vulnerable to involvement in violence and/or crime, Community PEERS engages Peer Support Workers to offer violence prevention services to communities.\n\nPeer Support Workers continue to develop their skills and expertise through ongoing coaching, training, job placements, and community of practice sessions while engaged in Community PEERS.\n\nTo access services through Community PEERS, please contact Asmaa Mohamed at [Asmaa.Mohamed@toronto.ca](mailto:Asmaa.Mohamed@toronto.ca)\n\nIntegrated Supports for Justice Involved Youth\n\n\n### Delivered in Partnership with Amadeusz\n\nProject Prosper aims to provide young people who have been incarcerated for firearm possession related charges with the tools, relationships, opportunities and access to services to support them in having a successful transition back to the community. The ultimate goal is to reduce participants\u2019 risk of involvement in future crime and violence.\n\nParticipants work with a Case Worker to identify the issues that they feel would help them create positive change in their lives, and to create a plan of support to address any needs including income, education, legal, employment, health, family, life skills, mentorship and resources for personal development. The Case Worker is intended to be a consistent, caring adult in participants\u2019 lives.\n\nThe project was developed based on a research project conducted by Humber College in partnership with [Amadeusz ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](http://amadeusz.ca/), The City of Toronto \u2013 Toronto Youth Equity Strategy and the Laidlaw Foundation. The research included interviews with local youth who have been incarcerated for firearm possession charges, as well as national and international evidence on the causes, and solutions for addressing gun violence. The evidence is clear that we must support young people to get the support that can help them make a successful transition back to the community.\n\n### Delivered in Partnership with Fernie Youth Services\n\n[Fernie Youth Services ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://fernieyouth.ca/) provides rehabilitative, community based service for young adults (ages 18-29) who have been referred through Probation & Parole \u2013 Toronto Anti-Gangs & Guns Unit. The TYES Support Services program provides case management support to 40-50 youth/young adults annually, through a youth-centred, trauma informed, strength based, holistic and tailored service to meet the individual goals, strengths, needs, circumstances and preferences of each participant.\n\nThe Case Managers will develop partnerships with City services and organizations that can support the needs of the client. The Case Managers seek to reduce recidivism and support individuals\u2019 through a holistic approach that considers each person\u2019s overall needs. Participants are supported through a Fernie Case Manager works with participants, and others from the participants support team to complete a Needs Assessment and Service Plan. The Service Plan sets out individualized goals that may include; living in a stable environment, improving relationships with family and positive friends, engaging in school and/or employment, participating in recreational activities, improving physical and mental health, addressing drug any drug or alcohol issues, learning new life skills and addressing their involvement in the criminal justice system.\n\nRestorative Justice Programs (RJP)\n\n\nRestorative Justice is a means to repair harm caused to people, relationships and communities through collective participation in resolutions. Through this program, youth participants will be able to identify issues that cause harm, be exposed to strategies to cope and manage conflicts, understand accountability and actively participate in resolutions\n\nThe Youth Violence Prevention team at the City of Toronto is currently working with community groups to implement Restorative Justice Programs in St. Jamestown, Danzig, Jane and Lawrence, and Sparroways.\n\n### Enhanced Restorative Justice Programs\n\nWhile maintaining the core values and principles, Enhanced Restorative Justice Programs bring a holistic approach and focus on deeper resolution strategies such as accessible education, wraparound supports, community engagement, and enhancing youth spaces to mitigate violence that youth are facing in communities across Toronto.\n\nThe Youth Equity and Violence Prevention team at the City of Toronto is currently working with community groups to implement Enhanced Restorative Justice Programs in Jane and Finch (Westview High School), Jane and Finch (Driftwood), and Scarborough (Woburn).\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=l9wz347ort0e)",

It will work\u00a0 to bring about a safe Toronto that promotes and celebrates the well-being and resilience of all residents by:\n\n- expanding the definition of community safety beyond crime or policing to include well-being\n- redefining what trauma means and deepening the ability of the City and its partners to be informed by it and respond to it\n- enhancing our ability to act early and advance preventive approaches\n- developing innovative mechanisms to use multi-sector data to inform decision making and integrate investments\n- implementing an effective multi-sector governance structure that brings our critical partners into co-ordinated leadership and action\n- committing to a long-term vision of community safety and well-being and a comprehensive plan to realize it.\n\n[SafeTO ![PDF](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-pdf.svg)](https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2021/ex/bgrd/backgroundfile-168551.pdf \"PDF Document\") will drive 26 priority actions across seven strategic goals: reduce vulnerability; reduce violence; advance truth and reconciliation; promote healing and justice; invest in people; invest in neighbourhoods, and drive collaboration and accountability. It provides a roadmap for how the City and social systems that serve Torontonians, such as community services, healthcare systems, education systems, justice systems, police and businesses, can work collaboratively across different sectors and across governments to support community safety and well-being.\n\nCommunity Safety and Policing Act\n\n\n[The Community Safety and Policing Act, 2019, S.O. 2019, c. 1, Sched. 1 Part XVI ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/19c01) mandates every municipality across Ontario to prepare and adopt a Community Safety and Well-being Plan by July 2021.\n\n### Legislative Requirements\n\n#### Establish a Multi-Level Advisory Committee\n\nMunicipalities will form a multi-sectoral advisory committee comprised of representation from the police service board and other local service providers in health/mental health, education, community/social services and children/youth services.\n\n#### Consultation\n\nThe Municipality will consult the advisory committee, affected communities and those that serve them on the prioritization of risk factors and to identify strategies to address them.\n\n#### Outcomes Framework\n\nThe Municipality will use relevant data to identify and prioritize risk factors that contribute to crime, victimization and community safety and well-being; and will set out measurable outcomes that the strategies are intended to produce\n\n#### Alignment with Police Service Board\n\nPolice Service Boards will implement business plans that align with and further the goals of the Municipality\u2019s CSWB Plan.\n\n#### Publish Completed Plan\n\nThe Municipality will report on and publish the CSWB plan.\n\n#### Review Plan\n\nThe plan will be revised within a four-year time frame.\n\nCommunity Safety and Well-Being Planning Framework\n\n\nOur work leverages the Community Safety and Well-Being Planning Framework developed by the Ministry of Solicitor General in partnership with a broad range of sectors including the City. The Community Safety and Well-Being Planning Framework includes:\n\n### Social Development (Upstream)\n\n- Social development requires long-term, multi-disciplinary efforts and investments to improve the social determinants of health and thereby reduce the probability of harm and victimization. Appropriate investment in social development will experience the social benefits of addressing root causes of crime and disorder.\n\n### Prevention (Midstream)\n\n- Prevention involves proactively implementing evidence-based situational measures, policies or programs to reduce locally identified priority risks to community safety and well-being before they result in crime, victimization and/or harm.\n- Opportunities to learn from prevention efforts can advise on strategic investment in social development\n\n### Risk Intervention (Downstream)\n\n- Risk intervention involves multiple sectors working together to address and/or interrupt escalating situations where there is an elevated risk of harm\n- What is learned by mobilizing risk intervention can inform how investments and strategies are deployed in the prevention and social development areas.\n\n### Incident Response\n\n- Immediate and reactionary responses that may involve a sense of urgency in response to crime or safety.\n- Initiatives in this area alone cannot be relied upon to increase community safety and well-being.\n\nPrioritized Challenges\n\n\nThe following areas have emerged from staff review of existing engagement and consultation data and reflect key principles in our approach to the SafeTO work \u2013 build on the existing community and institutional wisdom. It is important to note that, all of the prioritized challenges are interrelated and that there will be overlap in how the City responds to these areas.\n\n### Prioritized Challenge \\#1 \u2013 Community Trauma\n\n#### Rationale\n\n- Communities and neighborhoods that experience higher levels of inequities and/or experience higher levels of violence are most vulnerable to becoming traumatized. Unaddressed trauma can manifest in physical, emotional, and psychological harm creating negative impacts on community well-being, health and safety. Systemic racism and inequity are primary contributing factors of trauma.\n- There is growing evidence that the experience of trauma, multi-generational or intergenerational racial trauma, and early trauma as a result of adverse childhood experiences can cause life-long harm, poor health outcomes and in some cases perpetuate violence.\n- Community consultations amplified the need for the City to prioritize addressing trauma. Recognizing trauma as a contributing root cause and directly addressing the impact of trauma on individuals and communities through culturally responsive approaches can help facilitate recovery from the consequences and manifestations of trauma.\n\n#### Examples\n\n- Inter-generational and multi-generational trauma as a result of historic harms experienced by Indigenous peoples are often unacknowledged or unaddressed and can result in further traumatization as a result of negative interactions with government systems.\n- In recent years, Toronto has experienced attacks including the Yonge Street van attack and the Danforth shooting which resulted in mass casualties and victimization. Further, some communities experience more frequent exposure to community violence or adverse community experiences disproportionately. The compounding impact of these events can traumatize individuals and entire communities.\n- Preliminary data from the Office of the Chief Coroner for Ontario demonstrates there was a record-high number of confirmed opioid toxicity deaths in Toronto in 2020, with a total of 521 fatalities. This represents a 78 percent increase from 2019 and a 280 percent increase from 2015. There has been a notable increase in drug-related deaths since the start of the COVID-19 emergency. Substance use is often driven by trauma, and the increase in deaths has had devastating impacts on the loved ones of those lost and the frontline workers who supported them.\n\n### Prioritized Challenge \\#2 \u2013 Community Violence\n\n#### Rationale\n\n- Community violence \u2014 including gun violence, gender-based and intimate partner violence \u2014 has been on the rise in Toronto and was declared a public health issue by the Toronto Board of Health in 2019.\n- The traumatic impact of gun violence in communities is not only experienced by individuals, it is experienced by communities which can contribute to negative long-term health outcomes and can be a contributing factor to the propensity to commit violence.\n- There have been calls to strategically mobilize short-term and long-term actions in coordination with multi-sector partners, community leaders, and residents to interrupt the immediate risks of community violence and continuously work to prevent it.\n\n#### Examples\n\n- As of May 19, 2021, there have been 119 shootings in Toronto resulting in 46 injuries and 12 people losing their lives.\n- Incidents of gender-based and intimate partner violence are also increasing in Toronto, particularly through the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n### Prioritized Challenge \\#3 \u2013 Harm Reduction and Victimization\n\n#### Rationale\n\n- Experiencing both immediate and life-long harms or repeated victimization can be a risk factor of complex conditions that threaten community safety (e.g. mental health crisis, substance use, human trafficking, and hate crimes). Continued exposure to such harms can negatively impact the social determinants of health and further exacerbate the risk to equity-deserving communities.\n- Advancing policies and programs to reduce harm and victimization and further understand vulnerability will ensure individuals and communities have access to resources and supports such as victim/witness, psycho-social and other relevant supports that promote community healing while also beginning to address the root causes of these harms.\n- Vulnerability extends to instances of acquired brain injuries and developmental disabilities; the lack of understanding of these issues combined with the lack of appropriate supports presents an increased risk of engagement with the criminal justice system.\n\n#### Examples\n\n- The number of reported hate-related incidents in Toronto has increased by 51 percent in 2020 with clear calls from the community for the City to prioritize efforts to address systemic racism and inequity.\n- Mental health calls to police are occurring at a rate of approximately 85 per day, and 76 percent of all FOCUS Toronto situations respond to mental health issues.\n- Acquired and Traumatic Brain Injuries are another notable concern given their prevalence among populations experiencing homelessness; a study conducted in 2008 found that of 904 people experiencing homelessness in Toronto, 53 percent had sustained at least one traumatic brain injury.\n- In 2020, Toronto Paramedic Services responded to 3,861 suspected overdose calls, including 268 calls involving death. This is a 90 percent increase in the number of suspected overdose deaths attended by Toronto Paramedic Services. The criminalization of people who use drugs and limited access to harm reduction services, including safer supply, contributes to the increase of drug-related overdoses and death.\n\n### Prioritized Challenge \\#4 \u2013 Injustice\n\n#### Rationale\n\n- The reliance on an enforcement lens continues to perpetuate the over-representation of Indigenous, Black and equity-deserving communities in the criminal justice system. There is a lack of consistency in terms of the application of a community justice lens in the approaches that address the root causes of community safety and well-being.\n- Restorative practices are an approach to justice that focus on addressing the harm caused by crime while holding the offender responsible for their actions, through providing an opportunity for those directly affected by the crime (victims, offenders and communities) to identify and address their needs in the aftermath of a crime in a culturally specific approach.\n- Reintegration is the support given to offenders during their re-entry into society following incarceration. It can include treatment, restorative justice and suitable community-based supports or treatment.\n- There are clear calls from the community to mobilize culturally responsive restorative practices and reintegration approaches that embody cultural identity and tradition as forms of intervention within communities.\n\n#### Example\n\n- Nearly one out of every 15 young Black men in Ontario experienced jail time, compared to one out of about every 70 young white men, and incarcerated Black people were more likely to live in low-income neighbourhoods. A siloed approach to community safety that results in an over-emphasis on enforcement has been shown to perpetuate the over-representation of Indigenous, Black and equity-deserving communities in the criminal justice system.\n- Between September 2018 and October 2019, Toronto\u2019s Metro West Court\u00adhouse received approximately 306 youth cases from 23 Division and 312 from 31 Division. Taken together, 23 and 31 Divisions account for more than 40 per cent of all youth cases seen at the Metro West Courthouse.\n- Despite making up only 4.1 per cent of the population in Ontario under age 15, Indigenous children represent approximately 30 per cent of foster children.\n\nSafeTO Goals and Priority Actions\n\n\nBelow is a list of the SafeTO goals and priority actions.

2022 Work Plan\n\n\nThe [SafeTO Implementation Plan ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](http://app.toronto.ca/tmmis/viewAgendaItemHistory.do?item=2022.EX29.2) focuses on seven goals that will be achieved through 26 actions. As part of year one, the plan will focus on building a strong foundation which includes:\n\n- The introduction of an alternative crisis support service model that is community-led, client-centred, trauma-informed and focused on reducing harm, which will be delivered through [four community pilots](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/get-involved/community/policing-reform/?accordion=community-crisis-support-service-pilots).\n- The establishment of a Toronto Office to Prevent Gun Violence, through engagement with appropriate partners, to work with the community to enhance coordination of gun violence prevention and intervention efforts.\n- Better support for victims and communities impacted by violence, by enhancing the [Community Crisis Response Program](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/public-safety-alerts/community-safety-programs/community-crisis-response-program/) and community partnerships that provide trauma-informed, culturally responsive supports.\n- The creation of a multi-sector data centre for the purpose of informing real-time policy development and service planning.\n\nThrough the implementation plan, the City will also lead inter-governmental efforts \u2014 identifying investment priorities, creating long-term partnerships focused on shared outcomes, identifying opportunities to better coordinate and align existing investments and affecting policy change \u2014 as well as engage the community through formalizing the SafeTO Advisory Table. The group will be made up of City Divisions and Agencies, and will also include multiple sectors, grass-roots groups, and community leaders representing several core issues.\n\nEngagement\n\n\nFrom November 2020 to April 2021, City staff engaged in an extensive community consultation process. Engagement included population-specific, issue-specific, and geographic-based consultations as well as internal discussions with 18 City divisions, agencies and corporations.\n\nCommunity consultations were targeted to stakeholders providing services related to or directly experiencing challenges related to community safety and well-being. This was complemented by engagement with subject matter experts, residents and community thought-leaders. In total, more than 2,500 stakeholders were engaged, with written submissions also accepted.\n\nA public survey was available from March 1 to 15, 2021 that received an additional 1,500 responses. A [summary of the SafeTO consultation findings ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2021/ex/bgrd/backgroundfile-168553.pdf \"PDF Document\") is available online.\n\nSafeTO Collaborative Analytics and Learning Environment (SCALE)\n\n\nThe SafeTO Collaborative Analytics and Learning Environment (SCALE) is a collaborative platform that allows the City and partners to share data, identify effective interventions, and communicate lessons to advance prevention-focused safety outcomes. SCALE\u2019s work focuses on prototyping, piloting, and scaling approaches, all grounded in responsible data use. This initiative is a crucial contributor to the ongoing enhancement of safety outcomes, engaging municipal partners like the TTC, Toronto Police Service, University of Toronto, community organizations, and federal partners like Statistics Canada.\n\nAs part of [City council\u2019s mandate](https://secure.toronto.ca/council/agenda-item.do?item=2021.EX25.4) SCALE is a priority action in the SafeTO Community Safety and Well-Being Plan to develop a comprehensive strategy to share, integrate and analyze data across multiple institutions for the purpose of informing real-time policy development and service planning.\n\nIn 2023, SCALE launched the Community Safety and Wellbeing on Transit Dashboard\u00a0[Community Safety & Wellbeing on Transit.](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/transit-community-safety-data/)\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=vvv6o0yibvvv)\n\nPCFET0NUWVBFIGh0bWw PGJvZHk PHNjcmlwdD4oZnVuY3Rpb24oKXsndXNlIHN0cmljdCc7dmFyIGY9dHlwZW9mIE9iamVjdC5kZWZpbmVQcm9wZXJ0aWVzPT0iZnVuY3Rpb24iP09iamVjdC5kZWZpbmVQcm9wZXJ0eTpmdW5jdGlvbihhLGMsYil7aWYoYT09QXJyYXkucHJvdG90eXBlfHxhPT1PYmplY3QucHJvdG90eXBlKXJldHVybiBhO2FbY109Yi52YWx1ZTtyZXR1cm4gYX07ZnVuY3Rpb24gZyhhKXthPVsib2JqZWN0Ij09dHlwZW9mIGdsb2JhbFRoaXMmJmdsb2JhbFRoaXMsYSwib2JqZWN0Ij09dHlwZW9mIHdpbmRvdyYmd2luZG93LCJvYmplY3QiPT10eXBlb2Ygc2VsZiYmc2VsZiwib2JqZWN0Ij09dHlwZW9mIGdsb2JhbCYmZ2xvYmFsXTtmb3IodmFyIGM9MDtjPGEubGVuZ3RoOysrYyl7dmFyIGI9YVtjXTtpZihiJiZiLk1hdGg9PU1hdGgpcmV0dXJuIGJ9dGhyb3cgRXJyb3IoIkNhbm5vdCBmaW5kIGdsb2JhbCBvYmplY3QiKTt9dmFyIGg9Zyh0aGlzKTsKZnVuY3Rpb24gayhhLGMpe2lmKGMpYTp7dmFyIGI9aDthPWEuc3BsaXQoIi4iKTtmb3IodmFyIGQ9MDtkPGEubGVuZ3RoLTE7ZCsrKXt2YXIgZT1hW2RdO2lmKCEoZSBpbiBiKSlicmVhayBhO2I9YltlXX1hPWFbYS5sZW5ndGgtMV07ZD1iW2FdO2M9YyhkKTtjIT1kJiZjIT1udWxsJiZmKGIsYSx7Y29uZmlndXJhYmxlOiEwLHdyaXRhYmxlOiEwLHZhbHVlOmN9KX19aygiZ2xvYmFsVGhpcyIsZnVuY3Rpb24oYSl7cmV0dXJuIGF8fGh9KTsvKgoKIENvcHlyaWdodCBHb29nbGUgTExDCiBTUERYLUxpY2Vuc2UtSWRlbnRpZmllcjogQXBhY2hlLTIuMAoqLwp2YXIgbD1nbG9iYWxUaGlzLnRydXN0ZWRUeXBlcyxtO2Z1bmN0aW9uIG4oKXt2YXIgYT1udWxsO2lmKCFsKXJldHVybiBhO3RyeXt2YXIgYz1mdW5jdGlvbihiKXtyZXR1cm4gYn07YT1sLmNyZWF0ZVBvbGljeSgiZ29vZyNodG1sIix7Y3JlYXRlSFRNTDpjLGNyZWF0ZVNjcmlwdDpjLGNyZWF0ZVNjcmlwdFVSTDpjfSl9Y2F0Y2goYil7fXJldHVybiBhfTtmdW5jdGlvbiBwKGEpe3RoaXMuZz1hfXAucHJvdG90eXBlLnRvU3RyaW5nPWZ1bmN0aW9uKCl7cmV0dXJuIHRoaXMuZysiIn07ZnVuY3Rpb24gcShhKXttPT09dm9pZCAwJiYobT1uKCkpO3JldHVybiBuZXcgcChtP20uY3JlYXRlU2NyaXB0VVJMKGEpOmEpfTtpZighZnVuY3Rpb24oKXtpZihzZWxmLm9yaWdpbilyZXR1cm4gc2VsZi5vcmlnaW49PT0ibnVsbCI7aWYobG9jYXRpb24uaG9zdCE9PSIiKXJldHVybiExO3RyeXtyZXR1cm4gd2luZG93LnBhcmVudC5lc2NhcGUoIiIpLCExfWNhdGNoKGEpe3JldHVybiEwfX0oKSl0aHJvdyBFcnJvcigic2FuZGJveGluZyBlcnJvciIpOwp3aW5kb3cuYWRkRXZlbnRMaXN0ZW5lcigibWVzc2FnZSIsZnVuY3Rpb24oYSl7dmFyIGM9YS5wb3J0c1swXTthPWEuZGF0YTt2YXIgYj1hLmNhbGxiYWNrTmFtZS5zcGxpdCgiLiIpLGQ9d2luZG93O2JbMF09PT0id2luZG93IiYmYi5zaGlmdCgpO2Zvcih2YXIgZT0wO2U8Yi5sZW5ndGgtMTtlKyspZFtiW2VdXT17fSxkPWRbYltlXV07ZFtiW2IubGVuZ3RoLTFdXT1mdW5jdGlvbihyKXtjLnBvc3RNZXNzYWdlKEpTT04uc3RyaW5naWZ5KHIpKX07Yj1kb2N1bWVudC5jcmVhdGVFbGVtZW50KCJzY3JpcHQiKTthPXEoYS51cmwpO2lmKGEgaW5zdGFuY2VvZiBwKWE9YS5nO2Vsc2UgdGhyb3cgRXJyb3IoIiIpO2Iuc3JjPWE7ZG9jdW1lbnQuYm9keS5hcHBlbmRDaGlsZChiKX0sITApO30pLmNhbGwodGhpcyk7Cjwvc2NyaXB0PjwvYm9keT4=",

By providing immediate supports, the CCRP mobilizes local resources to address individual/group needs, coordinates community debriefings and facilitates information sharing. Long-term supports offered by the program include establishing training and education sessions, facilitating community safety audits, and fostering the development of innovative, community safety projects.\n\nAbout the Community Crisis Response Program\n\n\nThe Community Crisis Response Program (CCRP) works across the city of Toronto in partnership with community members, agencies, and internal City divisions to enhance community safety and wellbeing.\n\nThe CCRP team supports communities with the development of safety networks that create neighbourhood strategies which focus on Crisis Intervention, Crisis Prevention, and Crisis Preparation.\n\n- Crisis Intervention: providing support to communities after a violent or traumatic incident.\n- Crisis Prevention: supporting education, development of strategies and methods and making systemic policy recommendations that may prevent future violent incidents.\n- Crisis Preparation: developing local safety networks which can provide cohesive and collaborative responses to critical incidents.\n\nCCRP works with communities to identify concerns and develop localized strategies including the development of a coordinated community crisis response protocol.\n\nWhen communities have been impacted by violent and traumatic incidents, the CCRP further supports communities with the recovery and healing process.\n\nViolent and traumatic incidents include: shootings, shots fired, stabbings/slashings, swarming, community conflicts, gun/gang related activity, and raids/ execution of major search warrants.\n\n### Response Protocol\n\nThe CCRP is not a first response program. Members of the public are reminded to call 911 in emergency situations. The program is automatically activated 12-72 hours after a violent incident occurs.\n\nEach day, the CCRP staff gather and receive information on critical incidents from the police, news media, municipal services, community organizations and local place-based networks. CCRP staff communicate with community stakeholders to arrange needs assessments for crisis response activities and to mobilize supports where necessary\n\nCCRP Team\n\n\n**Management**\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| Stephen Linton<br>Manager<br>[Stephen.Linton@toronto.ca](mailto:Stephen.Linton@toronto.ca)<br>437-238-9521 | Kevin Bourne<br>Supervisor<br>[Kevin.Bourne@toronto.ca](mailto:Kevin.Bourne@toronto.ca)<br>416-677-5094 |\n\n**Community Crisis Response Program**\n\nThe Community Crisis Response Program (CCRP) works across Toronto providing support and resources to communities impacted by violent and traumatic incidents.

Sites include:\n\n- FOCUS Rexdale \u2013 22 and 23 Division (launched January 2013)\n- FOCUS Scarborough \u2013 41, 42 and 43 Division (launched April 2016, expanded to 41 and 43 in 2020)\n- FOCUS York \u2013 12 and 13 Division (launched October 2021)\n- FOCUS Downtown East \u2013 51 Division (launched October 2016)\n- FOCUS Downtown West \u2013 11, 14 and 52 Division (launched October 2016)\n- FOCUS Black Creek \u2013 31 and 32 Division (launched November 2019)\n- FOCUS East York \u2013 55 Division (Launched November 2024)\n\n### How Does it Work?\n\nA multi-agency team meets once a week to identify individuals, groups and places that are at a high risk of anti-social and/or criminal behaviour as either perpetrators or victims. By leveraging the skills and resources of diverse community partners, the initiative is able to respond to situations of Acutely Elevated Risk (AER) using multiple approaches \u2014 providing the community with the best possible interventions to respond to safety risks. The first element of response happens between 0 \u2013 48 hours following a meeting.\n\n### Acutely Elevated Risk (AER) Situations\n\n\u201cAcutely elevated risk\u201d refers to any situation impinging on individuals, families, groups or places where circumstances indicate an extremely high probability of the occurrence of harms or victimization. Left unattended such situations will require a variety of emergency responses including police, fire, EMTs, Mental Health, Children\u2019s Aid and others.\n\nThe \u201cacute\u201d nature of these situations is an indicator that:\n\n- Either chronic conditions have accumulated to the point where a crisis is imminent;\n- New compelling circumstances have contributed to severely increased risks; and/or,\n- If left unattended there are serious risks of either physical or psychological harm to self and others.\n\n### Submission of AER Situations to FOCUS\n\nSituations can be brought forward to FOCUS when:\n\n- Conditions of the situation have acute elevated risk as described above\n- Intervention for situation requires a multi-agency, wrap-around response.\n\n## FOCUS Toronto Situation Table Contacts\n\n### FOCUS Rexdale\n\n[FOCUSRexdale@toronto.ca](mailto:FOCUSRexdale@toronto.ca)\n\n### FOCUS Scarborough\n\n[FOCUSScarborough@toronto.ca](mailto:FOCUSScarborough@toronto.ca)\n\n### FOCUS York\n\n[FOCUSYork@toronto.ca](mailto:FOCUSYork@toronto.ca)\n\n### FOCUS Downtown East\n\n[FOCUSDowntowneast@toronto.ca](mailto:FOCUSDowntowneast@toronto.ca)\n\n### FOCUS Downtown West\n\n[FOCUSDowntownwest@toronto.ca](mailto:FOCUSDowntownwest@toronto.ca)\n\n### FOCUS Black Creek\n\n[FOCUSBlackCreek@toronto.ca](mailto:FOCUSBlackCreek@toronto.ca)\n\n### FOCUS East York\n\n[FOCUSEastYork@toronto.ca](mailto:FOCUSEastYork@toronto.ca)\n\n## FOCUS Toronto Coordination Team\n\n- FOCUS Toronto supports local situation tables with coordination, administration and special tools that strengthen outcomes for vulnerable populations.\n- FOCUS Toronto will mobilize Youth Violence Prevention initiatives in the six above noted identified FOCUS areas.\n- This structure also analyzes and evaluates the information being collected at the situation tables and key program areas to identify trends, gaps, operational/system level barriers and best practices in human service delivery systems for vulnerable populations.\n- Recommendations identified by FOCUS Toronto will influence partnership development, local planning, generate new priorities, opportunities for targeted investment and outcomes that will enhance community safety and well-being in the city of Toronto.\n\n## FOCUS Toronto Steering Committee\n\nThe FOCUS Steering Committee consists of senior leadership from Toronto Police Service, United Way of Greater Toronto and the City of Toronto and provides strategic oversight of the operations of the FOCUS Toronto model.\n\n## System Reform and Innovation Table on Vulnerability in Toronto\n\nThe role of the table is to drive system-level reforms that will increase the capacity of the City and its partners to respond effectively to complex health and safety risks involving vulnerable Torontonians, their homes or property, and their neighbours\n\n## Resources\n\n### Evaluation\n\n- An evaluation was conducted of FOCUS Rexdale in 2015.

TCHC [Community Safety Unit (CSU) ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](http://www.torontohousing.ca/current-tenants/tenant-safety/community-safety-unit) aims to foster community well-being and safety by building relationships with TCHC tenants, staff and community partners, delivering safety programs and enforcing various legislation as required to ensure the safety of all TCHC tenants and staff.\n\nIn 2021, the City of Toronto was [mandated ![PDF](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-pdf.svg)](https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2020/ex/bgrd/backgroundfile-157308.pdf \"PDF Document\") to conduct an independent review of the TCHC\u2019s Community Safety Unit. The City, in collaboration with TCHC, has been leading the CSU Review since the fall of 2023. A consultant, ConveneToronto, was hired\u00a0 to conduct the independent review.\n\nThe overall objective of the CSU Review is to produce an in-depth analysis of the CSU\u2019s operations, approaches and growth paths within the context of the City of Toronto\u2019s new and expanding commitments to community safety and well-being, as outlined in the City\u2019s [SafeTO:10-yr Community Safety and Well-Being Plan](http://www.toronto.ca/community-people/public-safety-alerts/community-safety-programs/community-safety-well-being-plan/). The final report will be submitted to Toronto City Council and TCHC\u2019s Board of Directors by the end of 2024.\n\nThe CSU Review, in focus and approach, aligns with the City\u2019s and TCHC\u2019s broader commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion. More specifically, it aligns with TCHC\u2019s Confronting Anti-Black Racism (CABR) strategy, as well as, reconciliation and confronting anti-Black racism, as expressed through the City\u2019s [Reconciliation Action Plan](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/accountability-operations-customer-service/long-term-vision-plans-and-strategies/reconciliation-action-plan/), [Toronto Action Plan to Confront Anti-Black Racism](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/get-involved/community/confronting-anti-black-racism/) and deliberate commitments to equity through policy frameworks that support equity-deserving and vulnerable populations.\n\n## CSU Black Employee Lifecycle Review\n\nTo further advance these commitments, the City of Toronto has integrated a Black Employee Lifecycle Review co-led by TCHC\u2019s Centre for Advancing the Interests of Black People into the broader CSU Review. The Black Employee Lifecycle Review will focus on the experiences of the unit\u2019s Black employees during the various stages of the employment lifecycle. The CSU Black Employee Lifecycle Review is being advanced through a shared leadership model between TCHC and the City of Toronto.\n\n## CSU Review Timeline\n\n### Complete:\u00a0Interviews and Focus Groups  January to August 2024 \u2013 Complete\n\nConveneToronto conducts.

        "markdown": "# TTC Safety Guide\n\n* * *\n\nAt the TTC, your safety is our top priority. Our team of Operators, Station Collectors, Customer Service Agents, TTC Special Constables, and supervisory personnel are dedicated to providing a safe and secure environment.\n\nYou can quickly identify TTC personnel by their uniform and distinctive TTC crest. Please take note of the following safety tips:\n\n- ### **Bus and Streetcar Safety Tips**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Avoid running to prevent slips, falls, or accidents.\n- Never try to stop a TTC vehicle by running in front of it. The driver may not see you.\n- Do not stick your arms or head out the window.\n- Stand behind the white line inside a TTC vehicle and hold onto stanchions to avoid falling when standing.\n- Carry bags, parcels, and backpacks in front of you and keep them clear of the doors when boarding or leaving vehicles.\n- Wait for the streetcar to stop and open its doors at streetcar stops, then look left and ensure approaching traffic has stopped before stepping onto the street. When exiting, look right and walk directly to the sidewalk.\n- Assist children on and off the vehicles to avoid separation.\n\n- ### **Subway Station and Train Safety Tips**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Keep a safe distance from the yellow platform edge until the train comes to a complete stop and the doors are opened.\n- Mind the gap between the train and the platform.\n- Assist children and avoid separation on the train.\n- Pay attention to door chimes and flashing lights warning of door closure. Do not board the train once the chimes start ringing.\n- Do not force open car doors to prevent injury.\n- Do not go down to the tracks. Notify a TTC uniformed employee if something is dropped on the tracks\n\n- ### **Escalator and Stairs Safety Tips**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Step on and off carefully and hold the handrail.\n- Stand facing forward and keep parcels off the handrails.\n- Keep clothing and shoes clear of the sides and tie shoelaces.\n- Be considerate of others and don't rush them.\n- If you have a mobility device or stroller, please use the elevators.\n- Keep children under supervision, and don't let them use the escalator alone.\n\n### **Stair Safety Tips**\n\n- Walk and hold the handrail.\n- Keep to the right to allow others to pass.\n- If you have a mobility device or stroller, please use the elevators.\n\n### Request Stop Program: Safety and Convenience for Nighttime Bus Travellers\n\nThe Request Stop program is available for solo bus travellers from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. Customers feeling vulnerable can exit the bus between regular stops by requesting one TTC stop in advance. The operator will stop safely for you to exit through the front doors.\n\n**Note:** this program is not available on streetcars due to safety reasons.\n\n### **TTC Safety Features and Personal Safety Tips**\n\n- Designated Waiting Areas (DWAs) have intercom access, benches, railing, enhanced lighting, closed-circuit-television (CCTV) cameras, and payphones.\n- Intercoms are located in Designated Waiting Areas (DWAs), in elevator cabs, at elevator landings, and at entrances not staffed by Station Collectors. They let you talk directly to the Station Collector.\n- Walk with confidence when going to or from a TTC stop. Avoid distractions, use well-lit areas, and be alert to your surroundings.\n- Lock your car, keep valuables out of sight, and do not leave your vehicle running.\n- Avoid distractions, hold bags tightly, and carry wallets inside your front pocket to avoid pickpocketing.\n\nFor additional safety tips, please visit our dedicated Emergency Protocols page.\n\n### Translations\n\n- [\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629 \\- Arabic](https://cdn.ttc.ca/-/media/Project/TTC/DevProto/Documents/Home/Riding-the-TTC/Travelling-Safely/General-Safety_ARABIC.pdf?rev=affba4b1c2f64fcbb93ddf0070ca982e&hash=CB33B2359355BB6441889EBB2C118F80 \"Arabic\")\n\n- [\u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587 \\- Chinese (simplified)](https://cdn.ttc.ca/-/media/Project/TTC/DevProto/Documents/Home/Riding-the-TTC/Travelling-Safely/General-Safety-CHINESE---SIMPLIFIED.pdf?rev=b73725a0930a43deb968604b7fbbb148&hash=86941749313FFDD9743507B291574FC7 \"Chinese (simplified)\")\n\n- [\u7e41\u9ad4\u4e2d\u6587 \\- Chinese (traditional)](https://cdn.ttc.ca/-/media/Project/TTC/DevProto/Documents/Home/Riding-the-TTC/Travelling-Safely/General-Safety-CHINESE---TRADITIONAL.pdf?rev=6b5ab0275f524feabcfdcaad7bbd3085&hash=746773142B0B00C95328E335D71EFDEE \"Chinese (traditional)\")\n\n- [\u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc \\- Farsi](https://cdn.ttc.ca/-/media/Project/TTC/DevProto/Documents/Home/Riding-the-TTC/Travelling-Safely/General-Safety_FARSI.pdf?rev=33f3c137ed944437a4adb41cdb2ff0db&hash=901CEFE665C7BBDAB501BF6D39FDED53 \"Farsi\")\n\n- [Fran\u00e7ais - French](https://cdn.ttc.ca/-/media/Project/TTC/DevProto/Documents/Home/Riding-the-TTC/Travelling-Safely/General-Safety-FRENCH.pdf?rev=ad0c0c2d3b0942a6ae8fa1baf108ef8a&hash=07E25CD8B0F9C93BA6B207A9B9A80A98 \"French\")\n\n- [Italiano - Italian](https://cdn.ttc.ca/-/media/Project/TTC/DevProto/Documents/Home/Riding-the-TTC/Travelling-Safely/General-Safety-ITALIAN.pdf?rev=ab4ab879be7e4111903a78b5fe4e28b6&hash=56FE47EDF4E0EDA88B20CE540FDA9D8F \"Italian\")\n\n- [\uc870\uc120\ub9d0 \\- Korean](https://cdn.ttc.ca/-/media/Project/TTC/DevProto/Documents/Home/Riding-the-TTC/Travelling-Safely/General-Safety_KOREAN.pdf?rev=fdcf89b0530245c8854cd5792eee2e67&hash=ED2207649983C05BE9D7F5275766FDAE \"Korean\")\n\n- [Portugu\u00eas - Portuguese](https://cdn.ttc.ca/-/media/Project/TTC/DevProto/Documents/Home/Riding-the-TTC/Travelling-Safely/General-Safety_PORTUGUESE-BRAZIL.pdf?rev=8e09d8d155a94325826d229a9c7b682d&hash=B95392827E8BB5B60E49DB32C3A3911E \"Portuguese\")\n\n- [\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \\- Russian](https://cdn.ttc.ca/-/media/Project/TTC/DevProto/Documents/Home/Riding-the-TTC/Travelling-Safely/General-Safety-RUSSIAN.pdf?rev=ee4d691ebb5449c5b21f7bc1ef3c539f&hash=E7562190B784FA25EDB5226C4FEDDDF9 \"Russian\")\n\n- [Espa\u00f1ol - Spanish](https://cdn.ttc.ca/-/media/Project/TTC/DevProto/Documents/Home/Riding-the-TTC/Travelling-Safely/General-Safety-SPANISH.pdf?rev=5b594d72f2fc42f7a6226738e1885b5a&hash=8225E835FA90047389A4DA0B0E6C8768 \"Spanish\")\n\n- [\u0ba4\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bcd \\- Tamil](https://cdn.ttc.ca/-/media/Project/TTC/DevProto/Documents/Home/Riding-the-TTC/Travelling-Safely/General-Safety---TAMIL.pdf?rev=8b9d729d88884d738f399fe367b12b4f&hash=C7AF44A28FDC8689BAEC369B8676B6F3 \"Tamil\")\n\n- [\u0627\u064f\u0631\u062f\u064f\u0648 \\- Urdu](https://cdn.ttc.ca/-/media/Project/TTC/DevProto/Documents/Home/Riding-the-TTC/Travelling-Safely/General-Safety_URDU.pdf?rev=803016f066d044218ef9f13c6a592a82&hash=D2C5BC375D32BC563FE6BA155E23BAB5 \"Urdu\")\n\n\n![Back to top](https://cdn.ttc.ca/-/media/Project/TTC/DevProto/Icons/back-to-top-arrow.svg?h=50&iar=0&w=40&rev=7b3e832e640c4c0482c3a4da8971a113&hash=FCC241F6B9BE7C0FC25FE1EEAB9B79D6)\n\nX\n\nCookies help us improve your website experience.\n\nBy using our website, you agree to our use of cookies.\n\n\nConfirm",

That\u2019s why it is important to know who to call and what to do under different circumstances.\n\nStay Informed\n\n\nIt is important to stay informed during an emergency. There are numerous ways to receive emergency information including:\n\n- newspaper, mail and hand-delivered information\n- telephone, email, internet and social media such as Twitter and Facebook\n- local television, radio and on-line news broadcasts\n- your superintendent, property manager and members of your community\n- follow the City on X [@thecityoftoronto](https://twitter.com/cityoftoronto).\n\nBe sure to share emergency information that you receive with all members of your household and your neighbours.\n\nThe City's Role\n\n\nWhen a large scale emergency strikes our City, Toronto will activate its Emergency Response Plan. The plan details the methods in which the City mobilizes its resources during a crisis. It also ensures all City organizations, emergency response services, and key agencies are fully aware of their respective roles and responsibilities.\n\nIt is equally important for all families, individuals, businesses and property owners to have their own emergency response plan to help them respond and recover from the emergency.\n\nIn situations where the size of the emergency is beyond the scope of the neighbourhood, building or community\u2019s Emergency Plan, and residents are displaced from their homes, first responders will contact Toronto Emergency Management to coordinate emergency assistance to those affected.\n\nDepending on the nature of the emergency, this response will include some if not all of the following services:\n\n- Dispatching TTC Vehicles to shelter people at site\n- Dispatching the Canadian Red Cross to attend to the affected residents\u2019 needs including: temporary accommodation, transportation, arrangements for food, clothing and other personal supports\n- In large scale events open an Evacuation/Reception Centre\n- Information and assistance with rehousing (if necessary) and coordinated updates to affected evacuees\n- Assistance with caring for pets and service animals\n\nSheltering in Place or Evacuating\n\n\nDuring an emergency, you may be asked to stay inside (shelter in place) or evacuate. In the event of an emergency, officials will advise you on whether you should stay inside or leave.\n\n### Sheltering in Place\n\nIf you are asked to shelter in place, there are ways you can protect your family and your property. You should have:\n\n- Your emergency kit and non-perishable food ready and on hand\n- A personal alarm or whistle that emits a loud noise that will draw attention to your whereabouts if you need help\n- A white cloth to hang up in a window and/or a balcony to identify your location if you need to signal for help\n- Ink marker to write messages on doors, windows or a cloth \u2013 if you need to signal for help\n- Aluminum foil to cover vent openings\n\n### Evacuating\n\nIf you must evacuate your home:\n\n- Follow the directions of emergency personnel.\n- Let someone know that you\u2019ve left and where you can be found.\n- Turn off your lights and appliances (except your refrigerator and freezer).\n- Turn off or reduce your heat or air conditioning.\n- Lock your doors.\n\n#### What to Bring\n\nRemember to bring the following with you if it is safe to do so:\n\n- Your Go-Bag\n- Cell phone, laptop, tablet, chargers and battery banks\n- Clothing and toiletries for each family member\n- Formula, bottles, diapers, favourite books, games and toys for infants and children\n\n#### Do Not Leave Your Pets or Service Animals Behind\n\n- Pets may become lost and/or not survive on their own.\n- Bring food and water, medications, favourite toys, identification tags and licenses for your pets.\n- Bring your leash/harness and pet carrier.\n- Toronto Animal Services works with homeowners during emergencies to provide options for dealing with their pets.\n\nLearn what to do [after evacuating](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/public-safety-alerts/emergency-preparedness/after-an-emergency/).\n\nPower Failures and Utility Disruptions\n\n\nPower failures and utility disruptions can be caused by failures in the system or external events, such as severe weather. A power outage may last from a few minutes to a few days. Prolonged power outages in extreme hot or cold weather may put your health and safety at risk.\n\nConveniences we regularly enjoy, such as elevators and running water,may be affected during a power outage. Toronto Hydro will work to restore power as quickly and safely as possible. Your patience is needed and appreciated while these complex issues are resolved.\n\n### During an Outage\n\n- Unplug all appliances (space heaters, toaster ovens, griddles, etc.) that may have been left on at the time of the outage and could ignite when they come back on.\n- Unplug computers, televisions, stereos and other electronics to prevent damage caused by power surges. (Use surge protecting power bars where possible.)\n- Turn off stove cook top and oven.\n- Turn off the water to the clothes washer and dishwasher if they were in use when the power went out, if possible.\n- Leave a light or radio on so you will know when power is restored.\n- Never use barbecues, propane or kerosene heaters, or portable generators indoors.\n- Never leave candles unattended.\n\nDuring an extended power outage, your building\u2019s property management\u00a0staff or community organizations, such as the Canadian Red Cross, might visit you at home to make sure you are safe.\n\nFires\n\n\nIn the event of fire:\n\n- Sound fire alarm and alert others.\n- Leave the building via the nearest exit, closing all doors behind you.\n- **Do not use the elevator.**\n- Call 9-1-1. (Don\u2019t assume this has been done.)\n- If you cannot leave the building, stay close to the floor and cover your mouth and nose to avoid inhaling smoke.\n- Move to the nearest window or balcony.\n- Wave a piece of cloth to attract attention from emergency services personnel.\n- Meet the firefighters when they arrive and tell them where the fire is.\n\n### Apartment Buildings\n\n#### To stay or go?\n\nMost of the time, the best thing to do in a fire is leave the building as soon\u00a0as possible. But in some cases, like if the fire is on a lower floor and is blocking your exit, you may not be able to leave. In either case you must act quickly as every second counts. The longer you wait, the more risk there is that heavy smoke will have spread into stairways and corridors.No matter what your decision, you must protect yourself from the smoke.\n\n#### If you decide to go\n\n- Check the door to your unit; if smoke is entering from around the door, do not open it.\n- Feel the door and door knob; if the door or knob are hot, do not open it.\n- If there is no smoke or heat, brace yourself against the door and open it slowly.\n- If you see smoke or feel heat, close the door quickly and protect yourself.\n- If the corridor is clear, take your keys, close the door behind you and go to the nearest exit stairway.\n- **Do not use the elevator.**\n- Open the nearest exit stairway door carefully.\n- If there is no smoke,use the stairway to leave the building in If there is smoke, do not enter\n- If there are other stairways, try them; n if there are not,return to your unit and protect yourself from smoke\n\n#### When you are inside the stairway\n\nIf you encounter smoke on your way down the stairs, follow these safety tips:\n\n- Leave the stairway at the closest floor and proceed to an alternate stairway.\n- Open the door to the alternate stairway carefully and if there is no smoke, continue down and leave the building.\n- If there are no available stairways to exit the building, return to your unit if possible, or enter the closest floor and bang on unit doors until you are able to take shelter in another unit.\n- Never go to the roof as doors to the roof can be locked.\n- Stay low to the ground if you are in a smoke filled environment.\n- Once out, stay out; do not go back into the building until fire fighters tell you it is safe.\n\n#### If you remain in your unit\n\n- Stay in your unit until you are rescued or until you are told to leave.\n- Keep smoke from entering your unit by sealing cracks around the door with duct tape and placing wet towels near the bottom; seal vents and air ducts with duct tape, wet towels or aluminum foil.\n\n#### If smoke enters your unit\n\n- Call 911, tell them where you are and move to the balcony with the door closed behind you.\n- If you don\u2019t have a balcony, go to the most smoke-free room, close the door and seal it with tape and towels; open the window for fresh air.\n- Show emergency personnel where you are by hanging a sheet from the window or balcony.\n- Listen for instructions or information from authorized personnel over the building\u2019s internal speaker system.\n\nFood Safety\n\n\nDuring a power outage, food kept in the refrigerator or freezer may become unsafe to eat. The following tips can help ensure food is stored safely in the event of a power outage:\n\n- Keep your refrigerator door closed (if possible) to maintain the temperature inside. Without power, the refrigerator section will keep food cool for four to six hours \u2013 if the door is kept closed.\n- Keep a fridge thermometer in your refrigerator so that you know when the temperature goes above 4\u00b0C.\n- Throw out perishable foods such as meat, fish, poultry, eggs and leftovers that have been at temperatures above 4\u00b0C for more than two hours.\n- \u00a0Keep your freezer door closed to maintain the temperature inside. Without power, an upright or chest freezer that is completely full will keep food frozen for about 48 hours if the door is kept closed. A half-full freezer will keep food frozen for about 24 hours.\n- Foods that have thawed in the freezer may be refrozen if they still contain ice crystals or are at 4\u00b0C or below \u2013 evaluate each item separately.\n- Partial thawing and refreezing may reduce the quality of some food, but food will remain safe to eat.\n- If possible, add bags of ice to the refrigerator and freezer to keep temperatures cooler for a longer period.\n- Discard any items in the freezer or refrigerator that have come into contact with raw meat juices.\n- If you are in doubt about whether a food item has spoiled, throw it out.\n- Contact your doctor or pharmacist for information about proper storage of medication that requires refrigeration, such as insulin.\n\nAlso learn how to [feed your baby](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/children-parenting/pregnancy-and-parenting/breastfeeding/breastfeeding-your-baby/feeding-your-baby-in-an-emergency/) during an emergency.\n\nDonate\n\n\nDuring an emergency, the City is unable to accept clothing or household items, as it doesn\u2019t have the capacity to store or distribute the items.\n\nClothing and household items can be donated to local community agencies that accept these items on a regular basis (e.g., Salvation Army). Community agencies also accept financial donations, which can be used to purchase goods or services to assist evacuated residents.\n\nDue to health and safety regulations food donations can\u2019t be accepted.\n\nThe City appreciates your interest and willingness to assist. The City cannot accept donations of prepared and/or store bought food. Contact Daily Bread or the local food bank in your community to find out how you can donate. The City will be working with local agencies to ensure resources are used to respond to the emergency.\n\nCanned goods and non-perishable items should be donated directly to community agencies. You need to check with the community agency before making a donation\n\nCommunity agencies also accept financial donations, which can be used to purchase goods or services to assist evacuated residents.\n\nVolunteer\n\n\nThe City of Toronto appreciates the support of residents willing to assist during an emergency.\n\nIn order to best serve community needs and ensure those volunteering are safe, trained and able to help in a meaningful way, the City recommends potential volunteers sign up ahead of time with an accredited volunteer agency that can provide proper training, screening and support.\n\nGetting involved with a volunteer agency before an emergency occurs will improve your ability to help during a crisis or when help is needed.\n\nAs part of its Emergency Plan, the City of Toronto is committed to partnering with community organizations that may assist in times of an emergency.\n\nBelow is a list of some community and faith based organizations where you may want to register as a volunteer. If you want get involved, click on any of the links and follow the instructions on how to register. These organizations have been identified as ones that may assist the City and its communities, in the event of an emergency situation.

In fact, residential cooking is one of the leading causes of fire-related deaths. The majority of kitchen fires begin with cooking equipment. Number one on the list of fire sources are stoves, including microwave ovens.\n\nExpand All Kitchen Safety accordion panelsCollapse All Kitchen Safety accordion panels\n\n## To Help Prevent Kitchen Fires\n\n- Keep pot handles turned toward the back of the stove: a small child could pull on a handle extending out at the front of a stove and be burned or scalded by the pot\u2019s contents. Avoid loose clothing while cooking: loose clothing can brush heating elements and easily catch fire.\n- Never leave food cooking unattended on the stove.\n- Never store frequently used items above the stove where you may be burned reaching over the hot stove to get them.\n- Remove pans of cooking fat or oils from the stove when not in use \u2013 it\u2019s easy to accidentally turn on the wrong burner.\n- Keep stove and oven clean because built-up grease and food particles are easily ignited. Keep combustibles (i.e. curtains, dish towels, plastic or wood utensils, newspapers, grocery bags) away from the stove, oven and all appliances.\n- Unplug kettles, frying pans and other appliances when not in use.\n\n## In Case of a Grease or Pan Fire\n\n- Turn off the stove. Smother flames with a pot lid or larger pan, if possible. Protect your hand with an oven mitt or wrapped dish towel.\n- Use of an approved portable fire extinguisher only if you are familiar with its safe operation.\n- Never throw water or use flour on a grease fire.\n- In case of an oven fire, close the oven door and turn off the oven.\n\n\nNever touch or attempt to carry a flaming pot. The contents may spill, spread or burn you.\n- If the fire is not brought under control immediately, get you and your family out and call 9-1-1.\n\n## What If I Accidentally Make Contact with a Flame or Hot Surface?\n\n- If your clothing catches fire: stop where you are, drop to the ground, and roll back and forth to put the fire out.\n- Immediately cool a burn with cool running water under a tap for five to ten minutes and then seek medical attention.\n\n## How Safe Is My Microwave Oven?\n\nMicrowave ovens are safe appliances, but if you accidentally place a twist-tie or other piece of metal inside an oven, \u201carcing\u201d may occur and pose a danger.\n\n- In case of fire, unplug the appliance and do not open the microwave door until the flames are out.\n\n## What Other Steps Can I Take to Prevent Kitchen Fires?\n\n- Make stove controls easy to read from a distance \u2013 perhaps mark \u201coff\u201d with a bright red dot.\n- Examine the stove and oven, toasters, coffee makers, and other cooking devices for signs of cracking, fraying or wear on cords and plugs.\n- Look for signs of overheating.\n- Check for recognized testing laboratory labels to show that the unit has been well designed.\n- Keep matches out of reach of children. Explain the dangers to your children.\n\n## Fire Extinguishment & Evacuation\n\n- A dry chemical fire extinguisher belongs in the kitchen. Mount it to the wall near an exit and not too close to the stove.\n- Know when and how to operate your extinguisher; read the label carefully for directions.\n- Remember, your first priority is to evacuate and call the Fire Department at 9-1-1.When purchasing electrical appliances and fixtures, look for the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) seal of approval. This is your assurance that the CSA has tested the products for shock and fire hazards. Ontario Hydro requires that only CSA tested and listed electrical appliances and fixtures be used in Ontario.\n- When purchasing fire extinguishers and smoke alarms, look for the Underwriters\u2019 Laboratories of Canada (ULC) label. This is your assurance that the ULC has tested the equipment and that it will perform satisfactorily provided you use it and/or install it in accordance with the listing specifications.\n\n[For more information on fire extinguishers and safety equipment](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/public-safety-alerts/safety-tips-prevention/safety-equipment-devices/)\n\n[Cooking and Smoking Fire Safety Tips Pamphlet ![PDF](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-pdf.svg)](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/8d11-Cooking-and-Smoking-Fire-Safety-Pamphlet.pdf \"PDF Document\")\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=e1bn3mkgfxv1)",

Protect your family and home from fire with smoke alarms and by planning your escape.\n\nChildren are one of the most at risk groups for injury or death in a fire. Parents and caregivers, [see what services Toronto Fire offers to your children\u2019s schools.](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/public-safety-alerts/understanding-emergency-services/fire-safety-information-presentations-and-event-booths/)\n\nInstall Smoke Alarms\n\n\nInstalling smoke alarms in your home provides valuable time for you and your family to escape when fire strikes. This early warning is critical because the majority of fatal home fires occur at night while people are sleeping. Place smoke alarms at the top of stairways leading to bedrooms and at the top of stairs leading from the basement. Every home must have at least one smoke alarm for each floor where there are sleeping areas and ideally one should be installed in each bedroom. Test your smoke alarms weekly and immediately replace batteries when needed. Carefully follow the manufacturer\u2019s installation and maintenance instructions. Smoke alarms are simple to install and save lives. For more information, visit our Smoke Alarms page.\n\nPlan to Escape\n\n\nDraw a floor plan of your home showing all possible exits from each room. Plan a main escape route and an alternate escape route from each room, especially bedrooms. When fire strikes, a planned step-by-step escape route can reduce panic and confusion. Most of all, it can save lives.\n\n#### Choose a meeting place\n\nArrange an outside meeting place and a safe location to call 9-1-1. The best place to meet is in front of your home, where firefighters will arrive.\n\n#### Practice your plan\n\nConduct a fire drill at least once every six months. The best place to start your fire drill is from a bedroom. Sound the alarm and get everyone in the home to participate. In a real fire, you must be prepared to move quickly and carefully without confusion. Don\u2019t rush through the drill. Make sure everyone knows exactly what to do. After the drill, discuss what took place and how to improve performance.\n\nMake your fire drill as realistic as possible. Practice two escape routes. Vary your drills. For example, one drill might place a fire in an attic while another might place it in a kitchen. Make sure everyone understands how escape routes are altered depending on different fire locations. Pretend that there are no lights, and that your escape routes are filling with smoke.\n\nEscape\n\n\n#### Crawl low under smoke\n\nHeat and smoke rise so the air by the floor is the coolest and clearest. If you encounter smoke or flames while evacuating, stay close to the floor. Get down on your hands and knees and crawl to the nearest safe exit.\n\n#### Test every door\n\nBefore opening any door, make sure it is safe to do so. Reach up with the back of your hand to touch the door, the door handle, and the space between the door and frame. If any of them feel hot, use your alternate exit. If everything feels cool, brace your shoulder against the door and open it carefully. Be ready to close it quickly if heat or smoke rush in. As you leave, close all doors behind you. Closed doors restrain the deadly speed of smoke and fire!\n\n#### If you are trapped\n\nClose doors between you and the fire. Use blankets or towels to cover vents and cracks between floors and doors. Wait at a window and signal for help by using a flashlight or by waving a bright coloured sheet or cloth. If there is a phone in the room, call 9-1-1, and tell them exactly where you are.\n\n#### In an apartment\n\nIt is important that everyone be able to unlock all locks quickly. Use stairways to leave the building. Don\u2019t use an elevator. The heat may activate call buttons and carry you to a fire floor. The elevator may also lose power.\n\n#### In a two-storey house\n\nMake sure everyone can unlock all locks and open all windows and doors quickly. Know how to escape safely from the second floor. Make appropriate arrangements for small children and people with special needs.\n\n#### Get out fast\n\nMake sure your family knows to leave immediately when they hear a smoke alarm or someone yelling, \u201cFire!\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t try to take possessions or pets.

This commitment requires innovation to deliver alternative or even higher levels of coordinated services.\n\nSPIDER delivers customized responses for the purpose of mitigating elevated health and safety risks that affect people, property and neighbourhoods.\n\nIt strengthens the effectiveness of City services in resolving complex situations that could not be resolved by City divisions working alone or in limited coordination with each other.\n\nSituations SPIDER Gets Involved In\n\n\nSPIDER is involved in situations involving the chronic hoarding of animals, possessions and refuse; multiple property standard and fire code violations; bed bug and other pest infestations.\n\nHow SPIDER is Activated\n\n\nMost SPIDER situations are first brought to the attention of City services by distressed neighbours and community members \u2500 sometimes through their councillor, but most times through 3-1-1 requests.\n\nVarious City divisions and agencies are first responders to complex property and community standards issues, some of which arise as a result of a person experiencing vulnerability.\n\nStaff from the division(s) who are first to respond will take the immediate appropriate actions to remedy the circumstance at the time but if issues are known to be chronic or of elevated risk, the case will be discussed at the SPIDER Situation Table to determine the best course of action to provide resolution.\n\nSPIDER is not designed to supersede normal City services.\u00a0 It is reserved for rare and complex situations.\n\nDefinition of Vulnerability\n\n\nThe City of Toronto defines vulnerability as a gap between the challenges a person faces and the resources they can access when facing those challenges.\n\nVulnerability must be assessed in context \u2013 a person\u2019s vulnerability or resilience will depend on their circumstances, environment and resources in the broadest sense.\n\nThis definition of vulnerability emphasizes service and resource gaps \u2500 not characteristics of the person \u2500 as the core driver of vulnerability and affirms the role of the service provider to make extra efforts to reduce vulnerability by closing these gaps.\n\nWhat to Do When You Need SPIDER in Your Community\n\n\nYou play an important role in ensuring the health and well-being of your family, friends and neighbours.\n\nIf you notice that there is an unsafe situation developing that may bring harm to a specific individual or the community at large (including property), do not hesitate to call 3-1-1.\n\n3-1-1 will know how to direct your call so that issues of greatest risk will be investigated first (e.g., fire code violations), and if necessary, will trigger response from other relevant divisions and/or SPIDER.\n\nIf you have an ongoing

Here are some tips to help ensure that everyone stays safe.\n\nExpand All Holiday Safety accordion panelsCollapse All Holiday Safety accordion panels\n\n## Supervise Children\n\n- Keep small toys, gifts, and breakables out of reach of infants and toddlers. Children like to place small objects into their mouth which may cause choking and could be fatal. The same also applies to rubber balloons. Balloons may break and the small pieces are enticing for kids to chew on. These pieces are similar in texture to your skin and may also cause a child to choke.\n- Be aware that Christmas tree electrical cords may pose a tripping hazard if left on the floor. Keep these and any other electrical cords secure so that a child does not have the opportunity to pull on them.\n- Do not leave purses with medications in areas where they can be reached by children. Whether at home or just visiting friends, this is a common way for children to get access to medications.\n- Don\u2019t leave small children alone in the home \u2013 even for a moment.\n- Teach children to stay away from candles, fireplaces, trees and space heaters.\n- Keep matches and lighters out of children\u2019s reach.\n- Keep electric toys away from natural or artificial trees and paper decorations.\n- When buying presents for children, check for flame retardancy labels.\n- You may have visitors who have food allergies, especially nut allergies. You need to inform all guests with allergies to ask what is in the food before they enjoy it.\n- When decorating for the holidays, be aware that tinsel is a common cause of choking for infants, toddlers, and animals. Dogs and cats are especially fond of this holiday decoration.\n- Keep infants, toddlers, and animals away from Poinsettias. Even though it is not poisonous, eating poinsettia leaves may cause vomiting.\n- Holly and mistletoe are considered poisonous and should also be kept away from children. If ingested, contact Poison Control.\n- Don\u2019t let children hollow out snow banks and play in them. The snow can collapse, trap, and suffocate a child. The same applies to playing on snow banks by the roadside, children could fall in the path of traffic or snow plows.\n- Keep all stairs in your home clear of toys and gifts.\n- While cooking, try to use the rear burners, this will help to prevent clothing catching on the pots that could cause a spill or burn. Never leave cooking unattended on the stove, children are naturally curious and may injure or burn themselves.\n- Always keep the draw strings for blinds and drapes high and out of reach of children. Children can have their necks become entangled and risk suffocation.\n\n## Christmas Trees\n\n#### Natural trees\n\n- Buy the freshest, greenest Christmas tree you can find.\n- Trees that are too dry have brittle branches that shed needles easily.\n- Test twigs and needles for flexibility. A dry tree will break, not bend.\n- Store the tree outdoors, preferably in shade, until you\u2019re ready to use it.\n- Cut one or two inches diagonally from the base of the tree.\n\n\nMount the tree securely in a large reservoir type stand that includes a water receptacle at the base to keep bottom of tree submerged in water.\n- Add water each day, always keeping the water level of the reservoir above the cut.\n- Keep the tree away from candles, fireplaces, heating vents, radiators, television sets, or other sources of heat.\n- Make sure your tree doesn\u2019t block fire exits.\n- Keep a multi-purpose dry chemical fire extinguisher on hand.\n- Use decorations that are flame-resistant or non-combustible.\n- Turn light strings off before you go to bed and when you leave the house.\n- Discard the tree when it begins to turn brown or dry out.\n\n#### Artificial trees\n\n- Artificial trees must have a fire-retardant label.\n- Metal or aluminum trees are conductors of electricity. Don\u2019t decorate them with strings of lights or with any electrical product.\n\n## Decorative Lighting\n\n#### Indoor lights\n\n- Examine light strings for wear or damage each year before re-using them. Replace worn sets.\n- Before replacing burnt out lights, unplug the light string.\n- Unplug all decorative lighting before you go to bed or leave your home.\n- Only use light strings, bulb reflectors, electrically lit decorations and extension cords that bear a CSA label and are marked for indoor use.\n\n#### Outdoor lights\n\n- Only use CSA labelled light strings and cords that are marked for outdoor use.\n- Turn off electricity to the outlet before working with outdoor wiring.\n- Use insulated tape, not nails or tacks to hold strings of lights in place.\n- Don\u2019t tape cords over, under, or along metal eavestroughs.\n- Run all outdoor cords above ground, keeping them out of puddles and snow.\n- To prevent moisture from entering bulb sockets, turn the bulbs to face the ground.\n\nTurn off all holiday lights when you go to bed, or when you leave your home.\n\n## Candles\n\n- Always stand candles in stable, non-tip candle holders before you light them.\n- Keep candles away from combustible decorations and displays.\n- Never leave candles burning unattended or within reach of pets or small children.\n- Extinguish candles by wetting their wicks before you leave a room or before going to sleep.\n\n## Holiday Parties\n\n- Use flame-retardant or non-combustible decorations and costumes.\n- Set up a designated smoking area outside with large, deep ashtrays, and soak the butts with water before dumping them in the trash.\n- Ask smokers to take it outside to reduce the risk of indoor fires and protect people from being exposed to harmful second-hand smoke.\n- Smokers need watchers. Before going to sleep, check under and around sofa cushions and upholstered furniture for smoldering cigarettes.\n- Please remember \u201cDon\u2019t Drink and Drive\u201d, have a designated driver.\n- Always have a first aid kit in your home. Be sure it is stocked and everyone knows where it is.\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=b1tune7kn4dz)\n\nPCFET0NUWVBFIGh0bWw PGJvZHk 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",

It will work\u00a0 to bring about a safe Toronto that promotes and celebrates the well-being and resilience of all residents by:\n\n- expanding the definition of community safety beyond crime or policing to include well-being\n- redefining what trauma means and deepening the ability of the City and its partners to be informed by it and respond to it\n- enhancing our ability to act early and advance preventive approaches\n- developing innovative mechanisms to use multi-sector data to inform decision making and integrate investments\n- implementing an effective multi-sector governance structure that brings our critical partners into co-ordinated leadership and action\n- committing to a long-term vision of community safety and well-being and a comprehensive plan to realize it.\n\n[SafeTO ![PDF](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-pdf.svg)](https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2021/ex/bgrd/backgroundfile-168551.pdf \"PDF Document\") will drive 26 priority actions across seven strategic goals: reduce vulnerability; reduce violence; advance truth and reconciliation; promote healing and justice; invest in people; invest in neighbourhoods, and drive collaboration and accountability. It provides a roadmap for how the City and social systems that serve Torontonians, such as community services, healthcare systems, education systems, justice systems, police and businesses, can work collaboratively across different sectors and across governments to support community safety and well-being.\n\nExpand All SafeTO: A Community Safety & Well-Being Plan accordion panelsCollapse All SafeTO: A Community Safety & Well-Being Plan accordion panels\n\n## Community Safety and Policing Act\n\n[The Community Safety and Policing Act, 2019, S.O. 2019, c. 1, Sched. 1 Part XVI ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/19c01) mandates every municipality across Ontario to prepare and adopt a Community Safety and Well-being Plan by July 2021.\n\n### Legislative Requirements\n\n#### Establish a Multi-Level Advisory Committee\n\nMunicipalities will form a multi-sectoral advisory committee comprised of representation from the police service board and other local service providers in health/mental health, education, community/social services and children/youth services.\n\n#### Consultation\n\nThe Municipality will consult the advisory committee, affected communities and those that serve them on the prioritization of risk factors and to identify strategies to address them.\n\n#### Outcomes Framework\n\nThe Municipality will use relevant data to identify and prioritize risk factors that contribute to crime, victimization and community safety and well-being; and will set out measurable outcomes that the strategies are intended to produce\n\n#### Alignment with Police Service Board\n\nPolice Service Boards will implement business plans that align with and further the goals of the Municipality\u2019s CSWB Plan.\n\n#### Publish Completed Plan\n\nThe Municipality will report on and publish the CSWB plan.\n\n#### Review Plan\n\nThe plan will be revised within a four-year time frame.\n\n## Community Safety and Well-Being Planning Framework\n\nOur work leverages the Community Safety and Well-Being Planning Framework developed by the Ministry of Solicitor General in partnership with a broad range of sectors including the City. The Community Safety and Well-Being Planning Framework includes:\n\n### Social Development (Upstream)\n\n- Social development requires long-term, multi-disciplinary efforts and investments to improve the social determinants of health and thereby reduce the probability of harm and victimization. Appropriate investment in social development will experience the social benefits of addressing root causes of crime and disorder.\n\n### Prevention (Midstream)\n\n- Prevention involves proactively implementing evidence-based situational measures, policies or programs to reduce locally identified priority risks to community safety and well-being before they result in crime, victimization and/or harm.\n- Opportunities to learn from prevention efforts can advise on strategic investment in social development\n\n### Risk Intervention (Downstream)\n\n- Risk intervention involves multiple sectors working together to address and/or interrupt escalating situations where there is an elevated risk of harm\n- What is learned by mobilizing risk intervention can inform how investments and strategies are deployed in the prevention and social development areas.\n\n### Incident Response\n\n- Immediate and reactionary responses that may involve a sense of urgency in response to crime or safety.\n- Initiatives in this area alone cannot be relied upon to increase community safety and well-being.\n\n## Prioritized Challenges\n\nThe following areas have emerged from staff review of existing engagement and consultation data and reflect key principles in our approach to the SafeTO work \u2013 build on the existing community and institutional wisdom. It is important to note that, all of the prioritized challenges are interrelated and that there will be overlap in how the City responds to these areas.\n\n### Prioritized Challenge \\#1 \u2013 Community Trauma\n\n#### Rationale\n\n- Communities and neighborhoods that experience higher levels of inequities and/or experience higher levels of violence are most vulnerable to becoming traumatized. Unaddressed trauma can manifest in physical, emotional, and psychological harm creating negative impacts on community well-being, health and safety. Systemic racism and inequity are primary contributing factors of trauma.\n- There is growing evidence that the experience of trauma, multi-generational or intergenerational racial trauma, and early trauma as a result of adverse childhood experiences can cause life-long harm, poor health outcomes and in some cases perpetuate violence.\n- Community consultations amplified the need for the City to prioritize addressing trauma. Recognizing trauma as a contributing root cause and directly addressing the impact of trauma on individuals and communities through culturally responsive approaches can help facilitate recovery from the consequences and manifestations of trauma.\n\n#### Examples\n\n- Inter-generational and multi-generational trauma as a result of historic harms experienced by Indigenous peoples are often unacknowledged or unaddressed and can result in further traumatization as a result of negative interactions with government systems.\n- In recent years, Toronto has experienced attacks including the Yonge Street van attack and the Danforth shooting which resulted in mass casualties and victimization. Further, some communities experience more frequent exposure to community violence or adverse community experiences disproportionately. The compounding impact of these events can traumatize individuals and entire communities.\n- Preliminary data from the Office of the Chief Coroner for Ontario demonstrates there was a record-high number of confirmed opioid toxicity deaths in Toronto in 2020, with a total of 521 fatalities. This represents a 78 percent increase from 2019 and a 280 percent increase from 2015. There has been a notable increase in drug-related deaths since the start of the COVID-19 emergency. Substance use is often driven by trauma, and the increase in deaths has had devastating impacts on the loved ones of those lost and the frontline workers who supported them.\n\n### Prioritized Challenge \\#2 \u2013 Community Violence\n\n#### Rationale\n\n- Community violence \u2014 including gun violence, gender-based and intimate partner violence \u2014 has been on the rise in Toronto and was declared a public health issue by the Toronto Board of Health in 2019.\n- The traumatic impact of gun violence in communities is not only experienced by individuals, it is experienced by communities which can contribute to negative long-term health outcomes and can be a contributing factor to the propensity to commit violence.\n- There have been calls to strategically mobilize short-term and long-term actions in coordination with multi-sector partners, community leaders, and residents to interrupt the immediate risks of community violence and continuously work to prevent it.\n\n#### Examples\n\n- As of May 19, 2021, there have been 119 shootings in Toronto resulting in 46 injuries and 12 people losing their lives.\n- Incidents of gender-based and intimate partner violence are also increasing in Toronto, particularly through the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n### Prioritized Challenge \\#3 \u2013 Harm Reduction and Victimization\n\n#### Rationale\n\n- Experiencing both immediate and life-long harms or repeated victimization can be a risk factor of complex conditions that threaten community safety (e.g. mental health crisis, substance use, human trafficking, and hate crimes). Continued exposure to such harms can negatively impact the social determinants of health and further exacerbate the risk to equity-deserving communities.\n- Advancing policies and programs to reduce harm and victimization and further understand vulnerability will ensure individuals and communities have access to resources and supports such as victim/witness, psycho-social and other relevant supports that promote community healing while also beginning to address the root causes of these harms.\n- Vulnerability extends to instances of acquired brain injuries and developmental disabilities; the lack of understanding of these issues combined with the lack of appropriate supports presents an increased risk of engagement with the criminal justice system.\n\n#### Examples\n\n- The number of reported hate-related incidents in Toronto has increased by 51 percent in 2020 with clear calls from the community for the City to prioritize efforts to address systemic racism and inequity.\n- Mental health calls to police are occurring at a rate of approximately 85 per day, and 76 percent of all FOCUS Toronto situations respond to mental health issues.\n- Acquired and Traumatic Brain Injuries are another notable concern given their prevalence among populations experiencing homelessness; a study conducted in 2008 found that of 904 people experiencing homelessness in Toronto, 53 percent had sustained at least one traumatic brain injury.\n- In 2020, Toronto Paramedic Services responded to 3,861 suspected overdose calls, including 268 calls involving death. This is a 90 percent increase in the number of suspected overdose deaths attended by Toronto Paramedic Services. The criminalization of people who use drugs and limited access to harm reduction services, including safer supply, contributes to the increase of drug-related overdoses and death.\n\n### Prioritized Challenge \\#4 \u2013 Injustice\n\n#### Rationale\n\n- The reliance on an enforcement lens continues to perpetuate the over-representation of Indigenous, Black and equity-deserving communities in the criminal justice system. There is a lack of consistency in terms of the application of a community justice lens in the approaches that address the root causes of community safety and well-being.\n- Restorative practices are an approach to justice that focus on addressing the harm caused by crime while holding the offender responsible for their actions, through providing an opportunity for those directly affected by the crime (victims, offenders and communities) to identify and address their needs in the aftermath of a crime in a culturally specific approach.\n- Reintegration is the support given to offenders during their re-entry into society following incarceration. It can include treatment, restorative justice and suitable community-based supports or treatment.\n- There are clear calls from the community to mobilize culturally responsive restorative practices and reintegration approaches that embody cultural identity and tradition as forms of intervention within communities.\n\n#### Example\n\n- Nearly one out of every 15 young Black men in Ontario experienced jail time, compared to one out of about every 70 young white men, and incarcerated Black people were more likely to live in low-income neighbourhoods. A siloed approach to community safety that results in an over-emphasis on enforcement has been shown to perpetuate the over-representation of Indigenous, Black and equity-deserving communities in the criminal justice system.\n- Between September 2018 and October 2019, Toronto\u2019s Metro West Court\u00adhouse received approximately 306 youth cases from 23 Division and 312 from 31 Division. Taken together, 23 and 31 Divisions account for more than 40 per cent of all youth cases seen at the Metro West Courthouse.\n- Despite making up only 4.1 per cent of the population in Ontario under age 15, Indigenous children represent approximately 30 per cent of foster children.\n\n## SafeTO Goals and Priority Actions\n\nBelow is a list of the SafeTO goals and priority actions.

2022 Work Plan\n\nThe [SafeTO Implementation Plan ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](http://app.toronto.ca/tmmis/viewAgendaItemHistory.do?item=2022.EX29.2) focuses on seven goals that will be achieved through 26 actions. As part of year one, the plan will focus on building a strong foundation which includes:\n\n- The introduction of an alternative crisis support service model that is community-led, client-centred, trauma-informed and focused on reducing harm, which will be delivered through [four community pilots](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/get-involved/community/policing-reform/?accordion=community-crisis-support-service-pilots).\n- The establishment of a Toronto Office to Prevent Gun Violence, through engagement with appropriate partners, to work with the community to enhance coordination of gun violence prevention and intervention efforts.\n- Better support for victims and communities impacted by violence, by enhancing the [Community Crisis Response Program](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/public-safety-alerts/community-safety-programs/community-crisis-response-program/) and community partnerships that provide trauma-informed, culturally responsive supports.\n- The creation of a multi-sector data centre for the purpose of informing real-time policy development and service planning.\n\nThrough the implementation plan, the City will also lead inter-governmental efforts \u2014 identifying investment priorities, creating long-term partnerships focused on shared outcomes, identifying opportunities to better coordinate and align existing investments and affecting policy change \u2014 as well as engage the community through formalizing the SafeTO Advisory Table. The group will be made up of City Divisions and Agencies, and will also include multiple sectors, grass-roots groups, and community leaders representing several core issues.\n\n## Engagement\n\nFrom November 2020 to April 2021, City staff engaged in an extensive community consultation process. Engagement included population-specific, issue-specific, and geographic-based consultations as well as internal discussions with 18 City divisions, agencies and corporations.\n\nCommunity consultations were targeted to stakeholders providing services related to or directly experiencing challenges related to community safety and well-being. This was complemented by engagement with subject matter experts, residents and community thought-leaders. In total, more than 2,500 stakeholders were engaged, with written submissions also accepted.\n\nA public survey was available from March 1 to 15, 2021 that received an additional 1,500 responses. A [summary of the SafeTO consultation findings ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2021/ex/bgrd/backgroundfile-168553.pdf \"PDF Document\") is available online.\n\n## SafeTO Collaborative Analytics and Learning Environment (SCALE)\n\nThe SafeTO Collaborative Analytics and Learning Environment (SCALE) is a collaborative platform that allows the City and partners to share data, identify effective interventions, and communicate lessons to advance prevention-focused safety outcomes. SCALE\u2019s work focuses on prototyping, piloting, and scaling approaches, all grounded in responsible data use. This initiative is a crucial contributor to the ongoing enhancement of safety outcomes, engaging municipal partners like the TTC, Toronto Police Service, University of Toronto, community organizations, and federal partners like Statistics Canada.\n\nAs part of [City council\u2019s mandate](https://secure.toronto.ca/council/agenda-item.do?item=2021.EX25.4) SCALE is a priority action in the SafeTO Community Safety and Well-Being Plan to develop a comprehensive strategy to share, integrate and analyze data across multiple institutions for the purpose of informing real-time policy development and service planning.\n\nIn 2023, SCALE launched the Community Safety and Wellbeing on Transit Dashboard\u00a0[Community Safety & Wellbeing on Transit.](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/transit-community-safety-data/)\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=19znhoe8u3ao)\n\nPCFET0NUWVBFIGh0bWw PGJvZHk 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",

        "markdown": "![City of Toronto](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/themes/cot/img/logo-print.svg)\n\n# Before an Emergency\n\nWhether you work, play or live in Toronto you need to embrace the fact that personal preparedness is an individual responsibility. Emergency responders do a great job keeping people safe, but they can\u2019t do it alone. Take action to prepare for the types of emergencies that could affect you where you live, work and visit.\n\nHave a Plan\n\n\nBeing prepared for an emergency starts with having a plan. Make sure everyone in your family knows what to do during and after an emergency.\n\nYour plan should include:\n\n- Where and how to exit your home safely (doors, windows and stairways)\n- A location, outside your home, where you will meet\n- The location of your emergency kit(s) or go bag(s)\n- The name of a person away from the emergency who can act as your family\u2019s contact if you get separated at any point. Make sure that everyone knows this person\u2019s name, address and telephone number\n- A list of key telephone numbers and addresses\n- The emergency plan at your children\u2019s school / childcare centre / or day program facility\n- A plan for your family in case you are separated \u2013 who could your children call for help or for information?\n\n### Steps That High-Rise Residents Can Take to Plan for Emergencies\n\nResidents should know:\n\n- The building superintendent\u2019s name and phone number\n- Locations of fire extinguishers, automated external defibrillator units and oxygen tanks\n- Location of emergency evacuation device(s)\n- Location of emergency exits\n- Who conducts your building\u2019s evacuation drills and how often\n- Where to meet family and roommates if the building is evacuated\n\nResidents are encouraged to set up a buddy system to check in on neighbours, especially the elderly and other residents that might have special needs. We encourage communities/neighbourhoods to identify vulnerable people in their area and do checks on them.\n\nReview and update your plan at least once each year.\n\nPrepare a Kit\n\n\nWhether you\u2019re just starting to prepare or are a preparedness pro, gathering your emergency supplies isn\u2019t hard. A good rule of thumb is to have supplies for at least 3 days or 72 hours. You\u2019ll probably be surprised at how much you already have.\n\n### Your Emergency Kit\n\n- Three day supply of drinking water (4 litres per person per day) and non-perishable food that meets your family\u2019s dietary needs including food for infants, children, seniors and pets\n- Manual can opening if you pack cans\n- Battery powered or crank radio, flashlight (including batteries) and personal alarm or whistle\n- Aluminum foil, duct tape and plastic wrap to cover vent openings\n- First aid kit, including hand sanitizer\n- Prescription drugs, medical supplies and special equipment for the family\n- [In Case of Emergency](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/public-safety-alerts/safety-tips-prevention/posters-pamphlets-and-other-safety-resources/?accordion=in-case-of-emergency-medical-information-sheet) information sheet about your particular needs, including contact information for your healthcare provider(s), caregiver(s), or personal attendant(s), and other emergency contact numbers including your veterinarian, and a detailed list of all prescriptions and medications\n\n### For Children and Infants\n\n- Formula\n- Bottles\n- Diapers\n- Medications\n- Favourite Toys\n\n### For Pets\n\n- Food, water and bowls\n- Leash/harness and muzzle\n- ID tags and licenses\n- Medications, and vaccination/medical records\n- Blanket and favourite toy(s)\n- Local animal shelter phone numbers\n\nPreparing on a Budget\n\n\nEmergency preparedness does not have to be expensive. There are some simple low cost things you can do that will help you get through emergencies like a widespread power failure. You should try to have some\n\nsort of emergency preparedness kit and a plan to help get you through the first 72 hours when an emergency happens.\n\n### Water\n\n4 litres of water per person per day is the ideal amount to have on hand. Having bottled water or water stored in other containers (thoroughly cleaned and sterilized) is a very low cost item to keep on hand.\n\n### Food\n\nHave a three-day supply of non-perishable food that meets your dietary needs, including food for infants, children, seniors and animals. If you are able to, put aside one can of food per week until you have 10 cans per person. Buy bigger cans for families and don\u2019t forget to have a manual can opener. Some examples of foods that last up to a year include:\n\n- Canned food like soups, fruits and vegetables\n- Canned fruit juices\n- Canned nuts\n- Peanut butter and jam\n- Ready-to-eat cereals and uncooked instant cereals\n  - Manual can opener \u2013 approximately $2\n  - Canned food \u2013 approximately $1-$3 per can depending on choice\n\n### Information / Light\n\nHave a battery powered flashlight and battery or crank radio for information.\n\nTip: Keep your cell phone charged and always keep a separate list of important contact numbers in case your cell phone loses power.\n\n- Flashlight / LED Lights: as little as $1 from discount stores (you may also be able to use your cell phone as an emergency light source)\n- Battery operated radio \u2013 $20 and up\n- Crank radio \u2013 approximately $40 and up\n- Back up charger for cell phones \u2013 $5 and up\n\nYour Go Bag\n\n\nIn addition to the 72 hour preparedness kit, every member of your household should pack a Go Bag \u2013 a collection of items you may need in the event of an evacuation.\n\nA Go Bag should be packed in a sturdy, easy-to-carry container such as a backpack or suitcase on wheels. A Go Bag should be easily accessible if you have to leave your home in a hurry.

This includes providing essential services like electricity, hot water and heat (during the coldest months of the year), and ensuring that physical conditions do not threaten the life, health or safety of tenants.\n\nPreparing your building(s) and residents for a weather related or other emergency such as a prolonged power outage is critical.\n\n### Before an Emergency Occurs\n\n- Develop an Emergency Plan; communicate it to all tenants and post it throughout the building.\n- Include relocation contingencies, such as location of your nearest identified emergency meeting point, available units in other buildings within your portfolio, transportation for tenants, etc.\n- In your plan be sure to include considerations for security with contact information (site security if the building is evacuated).\n- Implement a resiliency plan to improve the facility\u2019s ability to weather and emergency (enhanced windows, drainage systems etc.).\n- Encourage all residents/tenants to have adequate insurance.\n- Host a\u00a0[preparedness workshop ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/public-safety-alerts/understanding-emergency-services/fire-safety-information-presentations-and-event-booths/).\n\n### Vulnerable Populations\n\n- Have up-to-date contact information for tenants and their emergency contacts.\n- Have a plan for maintaining necessary on-site services and determine special needs.\n- Have a plan for checking in on your tenants before and after the event to see if assistance is required.\n\n### Other Tips for Preparing in Advance\n\n- Have a Community Bulletin Board where you post regular safety updates and where update will be routinely posted in the event of an emergency.\n- Conduct annual evacuation drills. Designate a meeting point at least 50 metres from your building.\n- Consider implementing \u2018Floor Captains\u2019 in your building where a volunteer resident maintains a focus on group safety.\n- Encourage all residents to have a personal preparedness kit that will lessen the impacts of an emergency event.\n- Have a supply of Emergency Lighting devices such as LED flashlights to supplement the building\u2019s emergency lighting\n- Have at least one battery / crank radio available that can be used in a common area for tenants to receive necessary information.\n- Evacuation Chairs for vulnerable residents that may not be mobile enough to easily evacuate the building during an extended power disruption.\n- Install a backup generator \u2013 ideally big enough to power all the building\u2019s needs but\u00a0 minimally to power one elevator to allow all residents to evacuate if necessary.\n\n### When an Emergency Occurs\n\n#### Respond\n\n- Have your property manager or superintendent conduct an immediate assessment of your property post-event.\n- City agencies may contact you to conduct physical inspections of the property to see if there is damage to the property. If the City contacts you by phone or email, respond quickly and appropriately.\n- Activate your security plan.\n\n#### Communicate\n\nIf your building has sustained damage and you are working on making repairs:\n\n- Let your tenants know, especially if you are experiencing delays.\n- Keep tenants informed of repair progress and let them know of any intermediary solutions you can provide.\n- If heat is affected, please take any steps recommended by professionals to keep pipes from freezing, as this may cause additional damage to your property and further delay restoration of services.\n- Let tenants know where to pick up mail as you arrange with Canada Post.\n\nFire Prevention for Landlords and Property Managers\n\n\nToronto Fire Services provides specific information for building supervisory staff regarding and their responsibilities as it relates to fire safety and the Ontario Fire Code. This includes but is not limited to the following information:\n\n- Prevention \u2013 tips to prevent fires that begin as a result of unattended cooking, candles, smoking, etc\n- Detection \u2013 Regular maintenance of fire alarm systems, sprinklers, smoke and CO alarms in units\n- Escape \u2013 ensuring exits are clear, procedures are in place, door closers are functional, and regular fire drills are being held\n\n### Fire Prevention Tips:\n\n- Smoke alarms should be replaced every 10 years\n- Fire Drills should be conducted every 3 months for supervisory staff in high buildings (regulated by 3.2.6. of the Building Code)\n- In the case of hoarding, contact the\u00a0[Specialized Inter-divisional Enhanced Response (SPIDER)](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/public-safety-alerts/community-safety-programs/spider/)\n\n### Fire Detection Tips:\n\n- Smoke alarms should be in all suites, outside all sleeping areas, and batteries should be replaced once every year\n- Carbon Monoxide (CO) alarms should have their batteries replaced yearly and should only be replaced in accordance to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions\n- 4 main sources of CO are the stove, fuel fireplaces, service rooms, and the garage\n- Supervisory staff must never shut down the fire alarm system or silence the fire alarm system before Toronto Fire gives permission\n\n### Fire Escape Tips:\n\n- Know your emergency response duties (Fire Safety Plan)\n- Be familiar with your building and occupants (persons requiring assistance)\n- Be thoroughly familiar with the operation of all fire emergency systems in the building\n\nWorkplace Preparedness\n\n\nIt is important to remember that an emergency can take place anyplace and at any time. The [Get Emergency Ready \u2013 At Work](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/public-safety-alerts/emergency-preparedness/workplace-preparedness/) preparedness guide addresses the most common emergency situations, including procedures for fire alarms, lockdowns, active attackers, medical emergency and upon receipt of suspicious packages or threatening communications.\n\nThe Importance of Insurance\n\n\nInsurance can help you replace what\u2019s lost, and help cover your expenses if you are forced to leave your home during an emergency. Discuss your needs with an insurance representative.\n\nAs a home owner or tenant, you are legally responsible for any damage\u00a0you cause to any part of your building and for unintentional harm caused to others who live in or visit the property. For example:\n\n- If your known faulty toaster oven starts a fire that damages not only\u00a0your apartment, but the entire complex, you may have to pay for the damage to your unit and the rest of the complex.\n- If someone slips and falls in your rental condo, you may be held financially responsible for the cost of the injured person\u2019s damages.\n- If your clothing, furniture or electronics are destroyed by fire or water damage, replacement costs add up.\n\nFor more information, visit the [Insurance Bureau of Canada\u2019s ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](http://www.ibc.ca/on/) website.\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=plvfiktr9bhj)\n\nPCFET0NUWVBFIGh0bWw PGJvZHk 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",

Carefully clean out any particles, dust, and cobwebs that may have built up over the winter. Newer barbecues have spider guards to prevent them from entering the burner and burner tubes, however if yours does not, use a pipe cleaner or wire to ensure that spider webs have not built up inside. Remove lava rocks and grates for a thorough cleaning with soap and warm water.\n- Clean your burner ports to ensure they are free of dirt and rust.\n- Make sure that the barbecue hose is in good condition, and is free of cracks. Propane or Natural Gas leaking from a cracked hose may send out a stream that if ignited can produce huge flames.\n- Check to ensure that all connections are tight and that there are no leaks. Do not use a match/lighter to check for leaks. You can brush a mixture of soap and water onto the connections and hoses (a 50/50 mix) and any rising bubbles will indicate a leak. Repair your barbecue so that there are no more bubbles.\n- Rusty, damaged propane tanks should be replaced by 10 years of age or less.\n- If you have uncertainty about the condition of any barbecue part you should replace it with a new component. Parts are available at most hardware stores and building supply centres.\n- Call a certified fuel appliance repair person if you do not feel comfortable completing safety checks yourself.\n\nHow Do I Properly Light My Barbecue?\n\n\n1. When your barbecue is safe and ready to be used, begin by opening the lid. Always have the lid in the open position when lighting the grill.\n2. Next turn on the gas by opening the Natural Gas Valve or Propane Cylinder Valve. After this step has been completed, turn on the barbecue at the grill controls.\n3. Finally, light the barbecue by depressing the igniter button. If your barbecue does not have an igniter button, insert a long match or barbecue lighter into the side burner hole. Have the match lit before you turn on the grill controls.\n\n**If the burner does not ignite**, keep the lid open, turn off the gas and wait five minutes before trying once again.\n\nHow to Shut off Your Barbecue?\n\n\n1. First shut off your Natural Gas or Propane Cylinder valve so that any remaining gas in the hose line burns off.\n2. Turn off your burner controls so that no gas remains trapped within the hose.\n3. Allow your barbecue some significant \u201ccooling off\u201d time prior to covering it.\n\nYour Propane Cylinder\n\n\nPropane is an economical and portable fuel that provides heat, cooks food, and generates light. It is used as a gas, but stored as a liquid in cylinders that can vary in size. The most common, the \u2018backyard barbecue size\u2019 is the 20-pound cylinder. When it is properly filled, 80% of the tank will contain liquid propane leaving the remaining 20% above the liquid to contain the propane vapour.\n\nIn Canada propane cylinders must be inspected and requalified, or replaced every 10 years. You can view the date that your cylinder was last qualified on the collar of the cylinder. It is also possible that a cylinder less than 10 years old may need replacing. A rusty and damaged cylinder could mean that you\u2019re ready for a new one. When you make your purchase, make sure to turn your old cylinder in so that it can be purged and recycled or disposed of.\n\nNew propane cylinders must be purged to release all of the air and moisture within before it is filled with propane. In Canada, only a properly trained and certified attendant is permitted to fill a tank. An attendant is not permitted to fill an outdated cylinder, or fill any cylinder tank beyond 80% of its capacity.\n\nHow to Change My BBQ Cylinder?\n\n\n- Make sure that you take your time while replacing your empty cylinder. Ensure that the special plug provided is threaded onto the outlet of the service valve when you disconnect the hose.\n- Carry the empty cylinder in the upright position with the safety valve on top.\n- Transport the empty upright cylinder on the floor of the passenger compartment in your vehicle for safety reasons. Secure it so that it cannot topple over while you are driving. Keep the windows open. (Note: Never leave a propane cylinder inside a parked vehicle with the windows sealed \u2013 as heat builds up, it could potentially cause an explosion). Refrain from smoking in your vehicle at this time.\n- Secure the new cylinder in place on the BBQ before you reconnect it. After reconnecting it, check for leakage using the soap and water solution.\n- Older style propane cylinders are required to be tightened with a wrench. Turning in a counter clockwise direction can tighten their left-hand threads. Newer style propane cylinder fittings do not require a wrench and tighten in a clockwise direction.\n- If your barbecue connection has an \u201cO\u201d ring, make sure you check it for fractures and cracks every time you replace your cylinder.\n- Never smoke while handling a propane cylinder.\n- Do not store extra propane cylinders beneath your barbecue or inside any structure as excess heat could cause the cylinder to release over pressure and propane along with it.\n\nAre you allowed to BBQ on your Condominium or Apartment Balcony?\n\n\nYou **ARE NOT** allowed to BBQ on your balcony if:\n\n- It is prohibited by the bylaws of your condominium\n- It is prohibited by the building owner or property manager of a rental property or apartment\n\nYou **ARE**\u00a0allowed to BBQ on your balcony **BUT ONLY IF**:\n\n- The balcony is open to the outside (no enclosure or walls are in place)\n- The BBQ is kept clear of combustible material as listed on the BBQ\u2019s rating plate or in the certified instructions\n\nIf you do not have a natural gas connection on your balcony and you use propane then you must follow additional rules:\n\n- The propane cylinder is transported in a service elevator. When there are no service elevators, you may use the passenger elevator, but you must be alone\n- The propane cylinder is kept on the balcony and connected to the BBQ at all times except when you are replacing it\n- The propane cylinder relief valve is at least one (1) metre horizontally from any building opening below it, and three (3) metres from a building air intake.\n\nNote: Toronto Fire Services does not regulate the use or transportation of propane cylinders and does not regulate or enforce the use of BBQ\u2019s on condominium and/or apartment balconies. Check with the owner/corporation of your building first regarding BBQ\u2019s on your balcony. For more information on regulations regarding propane use and transportation contact TSSA (Technical Standards and Safety Authority) at:\n\n1-877-682-8772\n\nor\n\nvisit them online at [www.tssa.org ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](http://www.tssa.org) and [www.safetyinfo.ca ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](http://www.safetyinfo.ca) for public education tips.\n\nTips for Charcoal Grilling\n\n\n- Ensure that your charcoal briquette barbecue is well ventilated as poisonous gases like carbon monoxide are released from the briquettes.\n- Do not use gasoline to prompt your charcoal briquettes to ignite quickly, instead use a proper charcoal lighting fluid. Allow the fluid to settle for a few minutes so that the explosive vapours have a chance to dissipate.\n- Stand back from the grill a safe distance while lighting the briquettes. Make sure you did not spill any lighting fluid onto your clothing or the area around the actual grill. Prior to igniting the briquettes, ensure that the can of fluid has been placed at a safe distance from the BBQ.\n- If the briquettes begin to die out, refrain from spraying the lighting fluid onto the hot coals, which could result in a very dangerous and explosive situation.\n- When you are done grilling, make sure that your hot coals are fully extinguished before you dispose of them. Hot coals are very dangerous and can easily start a garbage can fire.\n\nEnjoy Your Summer Barbecue but Remember\u2026\n\n\n- Keep children and pets far away from a hot grill, and never leave them unsupervised in the area of an ignited barbecue.\n- Never use wood, charcoal briquettes, barbecue starter fluid or gasoline in conjunction with your propane or natural gas barbecue. Doing so is likely to result in a highly flammable and volatile situation that may cause extensive damage to your property, personal injury or loss of life.\n- Barbecue in an open outdoor space due to ventilation and safety reasons. Keep the barbecue at least 3 metres from windows and doors.\n- Keep the barbecue away from wooden fences, wooden walls, combustible overhead roofs, and from trees with low branches.\n- Don\u2019t allow an accumulation of grease to occur by keeping your grill and burners clean \u2013 this will help to minimize the chances that you will have a serious grease fire.\n- Never fight a grease fire with water \u2013 this will only cause the flames to flare up. Keep loose clothing away from a hot barbecue \u2013 roll up your sleeves or cook in a short sleeved shirt. If your clothing catches on fire, quickly Stop, Drop and Roll.\n- Use long handled tongs and brushes while grilling that put an extra bit of distance between you and the flames.\n- Wear oven mitts and a heavy apron to protect yourself from fire while grilling.\n- If you do burn yourself, run the affected area under cool water for five minutes. If your burn is serious (charring, blistering) seek medical attention right away.\n\nSelect Information taken from Magazine \u2018SummerSmart\u2019 published by TSSA and the Fire Marshal\u2019s Public Fire Safety Council.\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=y4ptd92nmc20)\n\nPCFET0NUWVBFIGh0bWw PGJvZHk 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",

        "markdown": "![City of Toronto](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/themes/cot/img/logo-print.svg)\n\n# Workplace Fire Safety\n\nMake it your business to know.\n\nFire can break out anywhere, including where you work. Each year numerous fires in the workplace cause injury and property loss.\n\nIf a fire started in your office or in the building where you work, would you know what to do? Do you know your workplace evacuation procedures in the event of an alarm? What can you do to prevent fires in your workplace?\n\nKnowing the answers to these questions and following a few simple fire safety procedures can prevent tragic and wasteful fire loss in your workplace.\n\n[Public outreach Toronto Emergency Services can provide for your workplace](https://www.toronto.ca/?page_id=22307)\n\nExpand All Workplace Fire Safety accordion panelsCollapse All Workplace Fire Safety accordion panels\n\n## Be Prepared\n\nThese procedures are based on your workplace having a fire alarm system and an approved fire safety plan. Your building may not have an alarm system or a detailed fire safety plan. Your workplace fire evacuation procedures may differ. Make it your business to know the fire safety plan and evacuation procedures in your workplace.\n\n#### Employees should know\n\n- the location of two exits closest to their work area;\n- the location of the nearest fire alarm pull station and how to use it;\n- the phone number for The Toronto Fire Services (9-1-1);\n- your responsibilities in a fire, which are in the fire safety plan;\n\n\nthe fire emergency procedures posted on your floor.\n- if you work in a high building, visit the Fire in the Sky \u2013 Fire safety in high buildings page for more information.\n\n#### Employers are responsible for\n\n- preparing and implementing the Fire Safety Plan;\n- informing employees of the Fire Safety Plan;\n- posting fire emergency procedures on each floor;\n- conducting regular fire drills with all employees.\n\n## If You Discover a Fire\n\n- Activate the nearest fire alarm pull station on the fire floor.\n- Leave the area immediately, closing all doors behind you.\n- Take keys with you.\n- Go to the nearest exit and leave the building. Close all doors behind you.\n- If you encounter smoke, consider taking an alternate stairwell/exit. Heat and smoke rise leaving cleaner air near the floor. Crawl low under smoke.\n- Call the Toronto Fire Services at 9-1-1 regardless of the size of the fire. Never assume this has been done.\n\n\nGive correct address, location of fire and your name.\n\nMost workplaces contain portable fire extinguishers. Fire extinguishers can only put out small, contained fires, such as a fire in a wastebasket. The extinguisher in your workplace may or may not be suitable for dealing with grease or electrical fires.\n\nIf you have not been trained in the proper use of portable extinguishers, do not attempt to fight a fire.\n\n**Even with proper fire extinguisher training never fight a fire:**\n\n- if the fire is large or spreading.\n- if your escape route may be blocked by the spread of fire.\n- \u00a0if you are not trained in the correct use of the type of extinguisher or are unsure of the type of fire.\n\n**If you have fire extinguisher training and do choose to fight a fire:**\n\n\u2022 call the Toronto Fire Services first at 9-1-1\n\n\u2022 ensure everyone has evacuated or is leaving the area/building.\n\n\u2022 only fight a small fire.\n\nFor more information on portable fire extinguishers and their use, visit our fire extinguishers page under [Fire Safety Equipment](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/public-safety-alerts/safety-tips-prevention/safety-equipment-devices/).\n\n## Fire Prevention Tips for a Safer Workplace\n\n#### Smoking\n\n- Smoke only in areas allowed.\n- Use large, non-tip ashtrays. Do not empty contents into wastebaskets.\n- Check for smoldering cigarettes on furniture and in wastebaskets.\n\n#### Wiring\n\n- Check and replace any electrical cords that have cracked insulation or broken connectors.\n- Avoid octopus wiring.\n\n\nDo not run extension cords across doorways or under rugs.\n- Avoid plugging more than one extension cord into an outlet.\n- Use only CSA (Canadian Standards Association) approved power bars.\n\n#### Appliances\n\n- Use only CSA approved appliances.\n- Leave enough space for the circulation of air around heaters and other equipment such as computer terminals and copy machines.\n- Keep all appliances a safe distance from combustible materials.\n- Always turn off or unplug appliances at the end of each day.\n\n## Arson\n\nArson is one of the leading causes of fire in the workplace. To prevent or minimize the risk of fire due to arson, remember:\n\n- to be aware of your building security procedures;\n- report any type of vandalism and notify security and/or police of suspicious behavior and visitors;\n- lock doors after working hours;\n- ensure areas around your building are free of combustibles and are well lit;\n- keep all halls, lobbies and areas used by the public clear of obstructions.\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=p0qco81almz9)",

While this guide could not possibly address every emergency situation that could occur, it does provide response procedures that can accommodate various situations, such as those listed above. It does not replace existing Emergency Plans and Procedures, including Fire Safety Plans, but rather works in conjunction with these documents.\n\nThis guide was prepared in cooperation with the City of Toronto Corporate Security, Toronto Emergency Management, Toronto Fire Services and the Toronto Police Service.\n\nExpand All Workplace Preparedness accordion panelsCollapse All Workplace Preparedness accordion panels\n\n## Your Work Emergency Kit\n\nAn emergency can happen at any place and time, while you\u2019re at home and even when you\u2019re at work. If you were required to shelter in place or evacuate from your current location, would you be ready? Here are some things to consider when thinking about being prepared at work.\n\nYou may want to make sure you have the following supplies handy at work if you are faced with an emergency situation. For example, you could keep a knapsack or an easy-to-carry bag close by with some of these items (making sure you replenish them before expiry dates).\n\nKeep a pair of comfortable walking shoes at your desk.\n\nWalking home in your heels isn\u2019t fun.\n\nCarry some emergency cash\n\nATMs might not work during emergencies. You will need cash for necessities.\n\nMeeting places for family.\n\nCommunication modes (cell phones may not work.\u00a0 Have a designated spot to meet.\n\nFood\n\n- Emergency Food Bars\n- High Energy, No Prep/Low Prep Foods (Jerky, Granola Bars, Cocoa/Soup Packets)\n\nClothing\n\n- Clothing and Gear for all seasons\n- Coat, Hat, Gloves, Boots\n- Umbrella\n- Hand Warmers\n- Change of Clothing (Socks, extra sweater)\n- Comfortable Walking Shoes\n\n**L** **ight** **Source**\n\n- Flashlight\n- Extra Batteries\n- Non-Battery Flashlight\n- Glow Sticks\n- Flare Gun for car\n\n**Communication**\n\n- Extra Mobile Charger\n- Signal Whistle\n- Pencil & Notebook\n- Emergency Multi-Powered Radio (e.g. hand crank, shake, etc.)\n\n**Personal Items**\n\n- Time Passers, Cards, Book, Game\n- Extra medications\n\n**Important Papers & Money \u2013 most of these you can store on your mobile device**\n\n- Emergency & Non-Emergency Numbers\n- Emergency Family Contacts:\u00a0 Phone, Address & E-mail\n- Contacts at:\n  - Home\n  - Work\n  - School\n  - Day Care\n  - Out of Area\n  - Out of Province\n  - Current Copies of Family Photos & Identification Cards\n- Personal Medical Information such as:\n  - Medical Providers\n  - List of Medications\n  - Special Medical Equipment\n  - Medical Conditions\n  - Vaccinations\n  - Blood Type\n  - Allergies & Sensitivities\n  - Health Insurance\n  - Emergency Cash\n\n## Fire Alarm Procedures\n\nIf you discover fire\n\n- Alert others in your immediate area\n- Leave the fire area, closing all doors behind you\n- Activate the building alarm system, using the nearest fire alarm pull station\n- Call 911\n\nFire alarm systems\n\nMost facilities employ a single-stage fire alarm with some larger facilities utilizing a two-stage\u00a0fire alarm system. With a single-stage fire alarm, all building occupants must evacuate upon\u00a0activation of the fire alarm. With a two-stage fire alarm system, the affected floors would\u00a0receive an evacuation alarm, while the remainder of the facility will need to prepare\n\nto evacuate.\n\nIn the event of a fire alarm\n\nFire safety plans are unique and specific to every building. Employees should be familiar with\n\nthe fire safety plan for their work place and trained in building evacuation procedures. Fire\n\nsafety plans should be posted in a common area and readily available.\n\nSingle-stage alarm system\n\n- Evacuate immediately if you hear an alarm\n- Follow the directions of the fire wardens and building security staff\n- Do not use the elevators\n- Evacuate to the pre-determined assembly areas, well away from the building\n\nTwo-stage fire alarm system\n\n- In a Stage One alarm, prepare to evacuate\n- In a Stage Two alarm, immediately evacuate using the nearest exit\n- Listen to the announcements transmitted over the building\u2019s public address system\n- Follow the directions of the fire wardens and building security staff\n- Do not use the elevators\n- Evacuate to the pre-determined assembly areas, well away from the building\n\n## Medical Emergencies\n\nIn the event of a medical emergency\n\nImmediately call 911 and provide the emergency medical dispatcher with:\n\n- Your name and telephone number\n- The building name and address\n- The floor you are located on and your location on the floor\n- The nature of the emergency and any details available\n\nEnsure scene is safe and provide first aid based on your level of training:\n\n- Tell patient that help is on the way\n- Stay with patient until help arrives\n\nCall security as soon as possible \u2013 if they are onsite, they may:\n\n- Attend the scene with a first aid kit and/or an automatic external defibrillator and provide\n\n\nfirst aid medical treatment\n- Update 911 on the patient\u2019s condition and the exact location where emergency medical\n\n\nservices personnel should attend\n- Have a co-worker greet the emergency personnel and escort them to the patient\u2019s\n\n\nlocation quickly\n\n## Lockdown Situations\n\nThere are three basic types of lockdown situations:\n\n- Shelter in place\n- Hold and secure\n- Full lockdown\n\nShelter in Place\n\nThis type of lockdown situation is normally referred to when an environmental threat is\n\npresent outside and it is not possible or advisable to evacuate the facility. This type of action is\u00a0normally in response to an air contaminant and involves keeping the air contaminates outside the building and keeping persons from unnecessarily putting themselves in medical danger.\n\nExample \u2013 gas leak or chemical spill outside of the facility.\n\nWhat to do \u2013 if it\u2019s safe to:\n\n- Listen to instructions from emergency responders or building security staff\n- Proceed inside the building (if not already inside)\n- Close and secure exterior doors\n- Close windows\n- Turn off heating, air conditioning and ventilation systems\n- Encourage people to remain inside the building until the threat has passed\n\nHold and Secure\n\nThis type of lockdown situation is used when a serious environmental/physical threat is present\u00a0outside of the facility or in the neighbourhood and prevention measures need to be enacted to protect individual(s) from leaving the facility and entering into an area of danger, or prevent the threat from entering the facility.\n\nExample \u2013 active shooter in an area near the facility.\n\nWhat to do \u2013 if it\u2019s safe to:\n\n- Listen to instructions from emergency responders or building security staff\n- Proceed inside the building (if not already inside)\n- Close and secure exterior doors\n- Close windows and blinds\n- Turn off lights\n- Keep away from exterior doors and windows\n- Encourage people to remain inside the building until the threat has passed\n\nFull Lockdown\n\nThis type of lockdown situation is used when the physical threat is already in the facility and\n\nmeasures need to be enacted to prevent the threat from accessing areas where potential victims\n\nare or may be, or to protect individuals from entering areas where the threat may be present.\n\nExample \u2013 active shooter inside the facility.\n\nWhat to do \u2013 if it\u2019s safe to:\n\n- Listen to instructions from emergency responders or building security staff\n- Move to a safe area\n- Close and secure doors and windows\n- Barricade doors with furniture or wedges if unable to secure\n- Turn off lights\n- Keep away from doors and windows\n- Silence cell phones\n- Remain silent\n- Lay on the floor if gunshots are heard\n- Call 911 if it is safe to do so and if you have information such as location of attacker\n- DO NOT open the door for anyone \u2013 police and security staff will have a key and announce\n\n\ntheir entry\n- Remain in the lockdown response until police or security staff release you\n- If a fire alarm should sound during a full lockdown situation, do not automatically evacuate unless you smell smoke. Security or building management staff will likely give\u00a0instructions through the building\u2019s public address system\n\n## Threatening Communication\n\nGeneral\n\nThreatening communication is any form of communication that is intended to manipulate,\n\ncontrol, hurt, and/or intimidate in order to cause a change in the target\u2019s (victim\u2019s) behaviour.\n\nThreatening communication can be sent in a number of ways such as mail, email, social media,\n\ntelephone, voicemail, etc.\n\nUpon receipt of threatening communication\n\n- Treat all threats seriously\n- Immediately contact security staff\n- If the communication is deemed to be threatening, you will be requested to also report the incident to the Toronto Police Service\n\nIf the communication is received in writing:\n\n- Limit handling of the letter\n- Keep the envelope\n- Do not time stamp or write on the letter\n- Contact security staff\n\nIf the communication is received over email, do not forward the email to others.\n\nIf the communication or photos is received over social media:\n\n- Take screen shots of the threats\n- Note the date and time received\n- Note any other details about the threat that you can perceive (location, device being used, user handle names, etc.)\n- Do not respond or engage with the user\n- Contact security staff\n\nIf the communication is received over the phone or voicemail:\n\n- Note the date, time and phone number\n- Write down what was said in detail\n- Do not argue with the caller\n- Do not transfer the call\n- Do not make any further calls from the extension that the call was received on\n- Upon completion of the call, immediately move to a different phone and report the details of the incident by calling security staff\n\nAny threats of self-harm or harm to others or the environment should be reported as\u00a0soon as possible to your local police service. Use the non-emergency number but use\n\nyour own discretion (and/or discuss with a supervisor) whether the threat is serious or\n\nurgent enough to call 911.\n\n## Suspicious Packages\n\nGeneral\n\nA suspicious package is a package or envelope found or received by mail, courier or delivered\u00a0in person, which arouses the suspicion of the receiver because of suspicious indicators such as\n\nconstruction and/or marking characteristics.\n\nA suspicious package may be incorrectly addressed or poorly wrapped, or it may be a hoax (made to look like a device). Suspicious packages may indeed contain dangerous materials\u00a0such as an explosive device, some type of blade or a chemical or biological agent.\n\nEach type of suspicious package poses separate difficulties.\n\nUpon receipt of a package or envelope, the handler should first look for any indicators which may lead them to believe the package contains a threat.\n\nIf you determine a package to be suspicious:\n\n- DO NOT touch, open, smell, shake or move it\n- DO NOT carry the package to show others or allow others to examine it\n- DO NOT use radios or mobile phones in vicinity of suspicious packages\n- Immediately notify police by calling 911\n- Immediately notify security staff\n- Immediately notify your supervisor/manager and fire warden\n- Have building operations shut down the HVAC system\n- Have remaining building employees search their individual areas for suspicious packages\n- Evacuate area once exit routes are determined safe\n\nIf the suspicious package was found:\n\n- Attempt to establish ownership of the package by asking others around if it is theirs, did anyone see it placed there and if so by who, etc.\n- Check for secondary suspicious packages in area and on routes leading away from the area in which the original package was found\n- Once determined safe, evacuate surrounding area\n\nIf you come into contact with a leaked product:\n\nIn addition to the above procedures,\n\n- Isolate yourself from others \u2013 leave the room or area\n- Remove all clothing and place in a sealed plastic bag or container\n- Flush your eyes with lots of water\n- Decontaminate yourself using soap and water\n- Change into uncontaminated clothes (clothing stored in drawers or closets is likely to be uncontaminated)\n- Follow directions of emergency response personnel\n\n## Active Attacker\n\nGeneral\n\nAn \u201cactive attacker\u201d is an individual who is engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a confined and populated area.\n\nResponse actions\n\nWhen an active attacker is in your vicinity, you must immediately react. It is critically important to prepare yourself, mentally and physically, to deal with the situation.\n\n- Your first action should always be to RUN\n- If getting away from the active attacker is not possible, HIDE\n- If you can\u2019t run, and it isn\u2019t possible to hide, or if you are found, FIGHT\n\nRun\n\nIf there is an accessible escape path, attempt to get away from the active attacker. Be sure to:\n\n- Have an escape route and plan in mind\n- Evacuate regardless of whether others agree to follow\n- Leave your belongings behind\n- Prevent individuals from entering an area where the active attacker may be\n- Keep your hands visible to any emergency response personnel\n- Call 911 when you are safe\n\nHide\n\nIf evacuation is not possible, find a place to hide where the active attacker is not likely to find you. Ideally, your hiding place should:\n\nBe out of the active attacker\u2019s view\n\n- Be in a room with a lockable door or one that can be secured with furniture and/or wedges\n- Have heavy furniture such as cabinets and desks that you can use to block the door and hide behind\n- Have no sources of noise (silence phones, TV, radio, etc.)\n\nFight\n\nIf evacuation or hiding out is not possible, as a last resort, you should attempt to disrupt and/or incapacitate the active attacker by:\n\n- Acting as aggressively as possible against them\n- Throwing items and improvising weapons\n- Yelling\n- Committing to your actions\n\nPolice response\n\nWhen the police arrive:\n\n- Remain calm and follow instructions\n- Drop any items in your hands such as bags, jackets, etc.\n- Raise your hands and spread your fingers\n- Avoid quick movements towards the officers\n- Avoid pointing, screaming or yelling\n- Do not ask questions when evacuating\n\nRun/Hide/Fight is used with permission from the City of Houston Mayor\u2019s Office\u00a0of Public and Homeland Security.\n\n## Bomb Threats\n\nGeneral\n\nBomb threats can be delivered in a number of ways including over the phone, through email,\n\nin writing, etc. Bomb threats are designed to disrupt the normal flow of business by creating an atmosphere of anxiety or panic. While the probability of receiving a warning where an explosive device has been placed is quite low, it is important that all threats be treated seriously. Evacuations and/or detailed searches do not automatically occur for all bomb threats. The decisions on actions that are taken is specific to each threat.\n\nIn the event of a bomb threat\n\nIf you receive a threat by phone, email or mail:\n\n- Immediately contact security staff\n- Do not delete any email messages\n- Limit handling of a written threat\n- Call 911\n\nIf you receive a phone threat:\n\n- Remain calm and ask the caller the following questions:\n  - What time will the bomb explode?\n  - Where is it?\n  - What does it look like?\n  - Where are you calling from?\n  - Why did you place the bomb?\n  - What is your name?\n- Write down as much information as possible including: the time, telephone number, exact words used, identifying characteristics of the caller, etc.\n- Immediately contact the police through 911\n- Immediately contact security staff\n- Follow the instructions given by security staff and the police\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=373kh0epggnf)",

        "markdown": "![City of Toronto](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/themes/cot/img/logo-print.svg)\n\n# FOCUS Toronto\n\nFurthering Our Community by Uniting Services (FOCUS) is an innovative, collaborative risk driven approach to Community Safety and Wellbeing co-led by the City of Toronto, United Way Toronto and Toronto Police Service that aims to reduce risk, harm, crime, victimization and improve community resiliency and wellbeing. The model builds off of international best practices and lessons learned through the [Community Crisis Response Program](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/public-safety-alerts/community-safety-programs/community-crisis-response-program/).\n\nFOCUS Toronto Situation Tables\n\n\nThe model brings together the most appropriate community agencies at a weekly situation table to provide a targeted, wrap around approach to the most vulnerable individuals, families and places that are experiencing heightened levels of risk in a specific geographic location. Sites include:\n\n- FOCUS Rexdale \u2013 22 and 23 Division (launched January 2013)\n- FOCUS Scarborough \u2013 41, 42 and 43 Division (launched April 2016, expanded to 41 and 43 in 2020)\n- FOCUS York \u2013 12 and 13 Division (launched October 2021)\n- FOCUS Downtown East \u2013 51 Division (launched October 2016)\n- FOCUS Downtown West \u2013 11, 14 and 52 Division (launched October 2016)\n- FOCUS Black Creek \u2013 31 and 32 Division (launched November 2019)\n- FOCUS East York \u2013 55 Division (Launched November 2024)\n\n### How Does it Work?\n\nA multi-agency team meets once a week to identify individuals, groups and places that are at a high risk of anti-social and/or criminal behaviour as either perpetrators or victims. By leveraging the skills and resources of diverse community partners, the initiative is able to respond to situations of Acutely Elevated Risk (AER) using multiple approaches \u2014 providing the community with the best possible interventions to respond to safety risks. The first element of response happens between 0 \u2013 48 hours following a meeting.\n\n### Acutely Elevated Risk (AER) Situations\n\n\u201cAcutely elevated risk\u201d refers to any situation impinging on individuals, families, groups or places where circumstances indicate an extremely high probability of the occurrence of harms or victimization. Left unattended such situations will require a variety of emergency responses including police, fire, EMTs, Mental Health, Children\u2019s Aid and others.\n\nThe \u201cacute\u201d nature of these situations is an indicator that:\n\n- Either chronic conditions have accumulated to the point where a crisis is imminent;\n- New compelling circumstances have contributed to severely increased risks; and/or,\n- If left unattended there are serious risks of either physical or psychological harm to self and others.\n\n### Submission of AER Situations to FOCUS\n\nSituations can be brought forward to FOCUS when:\n\n- Conditions of the situation have acute elevated risk as described above\n- Intervention for situation requires a multi-agency, wrap-around response.\n\nFOCUS Toronto Situation Table Contacts\n\n\n### FOCUS Rexdale\n\n[FOCUSRexdale@toronto.ca](mailto:FOCUSRexdale@toronto.ca)\n\n### FOCUS Scarborough\n\n[FOCUSScarborough@toronto.ca](mailto:FOCUSScarborough@toronto.ca)\n\n### FOCUS York\n\n[FOCUSYork@toronto.ca](mailto:FOCUSYork@toronto.ca)\n\n### FOCUS Downtown East\n\n[FOCUSDowntowneast@toronto.ca](mailto:FOCUSDowntowneast@toronto.ca)\n\n### FOCUS Downtown West\n\n[FOCUSDowntownwest@toronto.ca](mailto:FOCUSDowntownwest@toronto.ca)\n\n### FOCUS Black Creek\n\n[FOCUSBlackCreek@toronto.ca](mailto:FOCUSBlackCreek@toronto.ca)\n\n### FOCUS East York\n\n[FOCUSEastYork@toronto.ca](mailto:FOCUSEastYork@toronto.ca)\n\nFOCUS Toronto Coordination Team\n\n\n- FOCUS Toronto supports local situation tables with coordination, administration and special tools that strengthen outcomes for vulnerable populations.\n- FOCUS Toronto will mobilize Youth Violence Prevention initiatives in the six above noted identified FOCUS areas.\n- This structure also analyzes and evaluates the information being collected at the situation tables and key program areas to identify trends, gaps, operational/system level barriers and best practices in human service delivery systems for vulnerable populations.\n- Recommendations identified by FOCUS Toronto will influence partnership development, local planning, generate new priorities, opportunities for targeted investment and outcomes that will enhance community safety and well-being in the city of Toronto.\n\nFOCUS Toronto Steering Committee\n\n\nThe FOCUS Steering Committee consists of senior leadership from Toronto Police Service, United Way of Greater Toronto and the City of Toronto and provides strategic oversight of the operations of the FOCUS Toronto model.\n\nSystem Reform and Innovation Table on Vulnerability in Toronto\n\n\nThe role of the table is to drive system-level reforms that will increase the capacity of the City and its partners to respond effectively to complex health and safety risks involving vulnerable Torontonians, their homes or property, and their neighbours\n\nResources\n\n\n### Evaluation\n\n- An evaluation was conducted of FOCUS Rexdale in 2015.

They will talk with you to understand what supports you need. The TCCS works with you to find ways to respond to your mental health needs.\n\nTCCS supports people 16 years of age and older. If you are under 16, call 211 (TTY 1-888-340-1001) to be connected to youth supports.\n\n### Supports & Services\n\n- Crisis intervention: Counselling and de-escalation for you and those around you.\n- Case Management: Working with you to achieve your goals and improve the quality of your life.\n- System Navigation & Referrals: Supporting you to access other social service programs including food, shelter, health care and employment.\n- Harm reduction: Providing substance use support, supplies, and counselling.\n- Essential Living Supplies: Providing food, clothing, and hygiene supplies.\n- Traditional Indigenous Supports: Supporting those who identify as Indigenous wholistically, with access to Elders, ceremony, medicines, and culture.\n- Afrocentric Supports: Supporting those who identify as Black through culturally meaningful approaches grounded in the lived experiences of Black communities.\n\nThe TCCS [story map ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/9828-Attachment-3-Visual-Story-of-Service-User-Experiences-scaled.jpg) illustrates some experiences from people who have used the service.\n\nIf you live outside of the City of Toronto and need mental health supports, call 211, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nExpand All Toronto Community Crisis Service: What We Do accordion panelsCollapse All Toronto Community Crisis Service: What We Do accordion panels\n\n## Can I call 911 and request the TCCS?\n\nYes. 911 call takers know about TCCS and will ask callers a few questions to determine what the best response for the situation is (ex. Ambulance, Police, Fire or TCCS).\n\n## Are TCCS crisis workers police officers?\n\nNo. All TCCS staff are civilians.\n\n## Do TCCS crisis workers wear uniforms?\n\nNo. All TCCS workers will have a lanyard and an identification card showing that they work for the TCCS. Some crisis workers may wear t-shirts or other clothing with the TCCS logo, but it is not mandatory.\n\n## How is the TCCS funded?\n\nThe TCCS is completely funded by the City of Toronto.\n\n## Does the TCCS respond to homelessness?\n\nThe primary focus of the TCCS is to respond to mental health crises. We recognize some callers experiencing mental health challenges may also be experiencing shelter and housing challenges. The TCCS will work to support their immediate needs. For street outreach and housing related supports, please contact [Streets to Homes](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/housing-shelter/homeless-help/streets-to-homes-street-outreach-support-program/).\n\n## How do I get a job with the TCCS?\n\nPlease visit the [community partners\u2019 page](?preview_id=850309) for current opportunities.\n\n## Can I call 211 on behalf of someone who I think needs support?\n\nYes. The TCCS is a voluntary and consent-based service meaning we will ask the person who you think needs support if they want to work with us. If they say yes, we will support them to address their mental health needs. If they say no, we will respect their choice and let them know we are always available if they need support.\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=v6nz47reh1hx)",

Do you have everything you need during an emergency? Learn about some of the risks in your community and how you can prepare.\n\nSevere Weather\n\n\nAs global temperatures continue to rise and the world\u2019s climate continues to destabilize, cities around the world are experiencing more extreme and unusual weather events including extreme temperatures, precipitation, droughts and storms. The incidence of [extreme weather](https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/water-environment/live-green-toronto/extreme-weather/) is\u00a0expected to increase in frequency and severity in the years to come.\n\nCheck for weather alerts and advisories before you go outdoors:\n\n- [Weather Network ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://www.theweathernetwork.com/ca/weather/ontario/toronto)\n- [Environment Canada ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://weather.gc.ca/city/pages/on-143_metric_e.html)\n- [Toronto and Region Conservation Authority Flood Forecast ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://trca.ca/conservation/flood-risk-management/)\n\n### Extreme Cold\n\nWinter storms such as blizzards, ice storms and heavy snowfalls may create hazardous conditions, frozen or burst pipes, and cause power disruptions. Health impacts associated with extreme cold include frostnip, frostbite, and hypothermia.\n\n#### Know Your Risks\n\n##### Health impacts\n\n- Potential health impacts associated with extreme cold include frostnip, frostbite, and hypothermia. In severe cases, hypothermia can lead to organ failure and even death.\n- People most at risk of cold-related illness are people experiencing homelessness, people who work outdoors, people with a pre-existing heart condition or respiratory illness, people taking certain medications, and infants and young children.\n\n##### Water pipes impacts\n\n- Frozen pipes can leave you with no water and cause your pipes to burst, leading to expensive property damage. If your pipes are prone to freezing, you may wish to contact a plumber for advice.\n\n##### Road impacts\n\n- Damage and disruption to roads, transportation systems and other infrastructure.\n- Dangerous driving and walking conditions.\n\n#### During a winter storm or extreme cold event\n\n##### Stay active and safe\n\n- Wear waterproof and windproof outer layers, a hat and warm mittens.\n- Choose wool, silk or polypropylene inner layers of clothing; these materials hold more body heat than cotton.\n- Change into dry clothing as soon as possible if you get wet from precipitation, sweat or submersion in water.\n- Wear several layers of warm lightweight clothing when shoveling snow and follow medical advice if you have a history of back or heart problems.\n- Reschedule outdoor activities and limit time outdoors if severe weather is forecast.\n- Notify friends or family where you will be when going on outdoor activities, such as hiking and skiing.\n- Take care when walking on ice, many cold-weather injuries result from slips and falls on ice-covered surfaces.\n- Keep your steps and walkways free of ice and snow by using rock salt or other de-icing compounds.\n- Call 311 for information on sidewalk snow clearing and free snow removal services for senior and disabled persons.\n\n##### Be cautious about travel\n\n- Listen to the weather forecast.\n- Avoid traveling in low visibility and on ice covered roads.\n- Clear your vehicle windows of all frost and snow so you can clearly see pedestrians, cyclists and other road users.\n- Take a charged mobile phone.\n- Make sure your car has a survival kit including a first aid kit, water and additional warm clothing and let someone know your destination and when you expect to arrive.\n- Cycle along the [City\u2019s network of cycling snow routes](https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/streets-parking-transportation/cycling-in-toronto/cycling-google-map/cycling-routes-snow-removal/), which receive enhanced levels of snow plowing, salting and snow removal.\n\n[Services for people exeriencing homelessness](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/housing-shelter/homeless-help/)\n\nDuring an Extreme Cold Weather Alert, service providers focus on helping homeless people to get off the street and into shelter or street respite.\n\nIf you see someone in need of assistance call 311 or central intake 1-877-338-3398 (free call).\n\nTake steps to protect your pipes from freezing.\n\n- The pipes in your home can freeze in cold weather. This can leave you with no water or cause your pipes to burst, leading to expensive property damage. Take steps to [protect your pipes from freezing](https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/water-environment/your-water-pipes-meter/water-related-help-advice/prevent-or-thaw-frozen-pipes/) and learn what to do if they freeze.\n\n### Extreme Heat\n\nHeat waves are often accompanied by high humidity, which can make the temperature feel hotter and can decrease the ability for the body to cool itself. In the future, Toronto is expected to experience much higher temperatures and more extended heat waves.\n\n#### Know Your Risks\n\nThe higher the temperature and the longer it lasts, the greater the risk of death during a heat wave. High levels of air pollution often occur during hot weather conditions. People with heart and lung conditions, seniors and children should pay special attention to the hourly Air Quality Health Index levels and forecasts.\n\nThe risk of power outages also increases during periods of extreme heat as the demand for electricity can exceed the capacity of the electrical system.\n\nDuring the summer, the combination of high heat, humidity, and smog can be life-threatening, especially for:\n\n- the elderly, young children and those who are ill or overweight;\n- people who exercise vigorously or are involved in strenuous work outdoors for prolonged periods;\n- people taking certain medications for various health conditions.\n\n### Storm and Wind Hazards\n\nSevere storms such as tornados and hurricanes vary seasonally and can pose serious risks through rain, high winds, lightning and hail in any season. High-speed winds can cause death, injury and millions of dollars in property damage.\n\n### Lightning\n\nLightning strikes and lightning injuries are infrequent in Toronto, but weather systems that may bring lightning can come with little warning.\n\nBe prepared for an electrical storm by checking the weather forecast before leaving home for a day outdoors. In Canada, the Environment and Climate Change Canada website has the latest information.\n\n**In Case of Lightning**\n\nLightning strikes and lightning injuries are infrequent in Toronto, but weather systems that may bring lightning can come with little warning.\n\nBe prepared for an electrical storm by checking the weather forecast before leaving home for a day outdoors. In Canada, the Environment and Climate Change Canada website has the latest information.\n\n- Even if there is no rain, if you can hear thunder, you are within striking distance of lightning. Seek shelter immediately.\n- Good places to take shelter include an automobile (with a metal roof), or a grounded building such as a house. Stay sheltered for 30 minutes after the last flash of lightning.\n- While indoors, refrain from using, and preferably unplug electronic equipment such as televisions and computers, as well as appliances, (corded) power tools, or (corded) telephones. Refrain from bathing, showering or washing dishes.\n- If caught outdoors during a thunderstorm, stay away from tall objects such as trees, or any objects or structures that conduct electricity, including metal fences, golf clubs, lawnmowers, bicycles, or umbrellas. Avoid bodies of water.\n- Avoid being the high point in an open area. Low-lying areas are preferable to hillsides.\n- If lighting strikes nearby (for example, if 30 or fewer seconds elapse between the flash of lighting and the thunderclap) when you are outdoors with no suitable place to take shelter, crouch down, putting your feet together with the heels touching, and your hands over your ears to protect against hearing damage.\n\n**If Someone Has Been Struck by Lightning**\n\nIf someone has been struck by lightning, call 911 immediately. People who have been struck by lighting may be in shock, and/or suffering from burns. If breathing has stopped, perform CPR until paramedics arrive. People who have been struck by lightning do not carry an electrical charge and can be safely handled right away.\n\nFlooding\n\n\nMajor rain storms can cause flooding, especially in low-lying areas. Flash floods may occur without warning as streams and rivers overflow their banks. Heavy rain may also cause sewers to back up.\n\nFor flooding related to rivers, the [Toronto and Region Conservation Authority ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](http://trca.ca/flood) 24 hour flood line number is 416-661-6514. For [basement flooding](https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/water-environment/managing-rain-melted-snow/basement-flooding/) and sewer back-up, call 311.\n\n### Know Your Risks\n\nThe risks associated with extreme rain include:\n\n- basement flooding;\n- flooding and damage to public and private property, including roadways, parks and ravines;\n- disruption of transit systems and public utilities;\n- power outages and disruptions to city-wide transportation systems, sewer and water systems, etc.\n\n### Actions You Can Take Now\n\nIt is essential for property owners to take steps to reduce the risk of basement flooding on their own private property. The improvements that the City is making to its complex system of underground pipes, sewers and catch basins cannot completely protect your home from basement flooding.\n\nMore information:\n\n- [Causes of basement flooding on private property](https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/water-environment/managing-rain-melted-snow/basement-flooding/?accordion=causes-of-basement-flooding)\n- [Reduce your risk of basement flooding](https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/water-environment/managing-rain-melted-snow/basement-flooding/how-to-prevent-basement-flooding/)\n- [Subsidies for basement flooding protection measures](https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/water-environment/managing-rain-melted-snow/basement-flooding/basement-flooding-protection-subsidy-program/)\n- [Disconnect your downspout](https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/water-environment/managing-rain-melted-snow/basement-flooding/mandatory-downspout-disconnection/)\n- [Home Flooding Mitigation Techniques ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](http://www.ibc.ca/qc/home/risk-management/mitigation-techniques) (Insurance Bureau of Canada)\n\nMore ways to reduce the risk of flooding\n\n- [Plant trees](https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/water-environment/trees/)\n- [Install a green roof](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/planning-development/official-plan-guidelines/green-roofs/)\n- [Install a rain garden ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](http://www.trca.on.ca/dotAsset/206574.pdf \"PDF Document\")\n\nMaintain the trees on your property\n\n- Regularly inspect and prune the trees on your property to encourage health and reduce the risk of damaged or diseased limbs falling on power lines during extreme storms.\n\n#### During Extreme Rain or Flooding\n\nIf you are indoors:\n\n- Stay inside and do not travel unless absolutely necessary\n- Keep children and pets indoors\n- Check for weather alerts and advisories before you go outdoors:\n  - [Weather Network ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](http://www.theweathernetwork.com/ca/weather/ontario/toronto)\n  - [Environment and Climate Change Canada ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://weather.gc.ca/city/pages/on-143_metric_e.html)\n  - [Toronto and Region Conservation Authority Flood Forecast ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://trca.ca/conservation/flood-risk-management/flood-forecasting-warnings/)\n\nIf you are outdoors:\n\n- Seek shelter immediately\n- Keep everyone away from lakes, rivers, creeks and low-lying areas that may be prone to flooding\n\nIf you are in a vehicle:\n\n- Get out of your vehicle and sit on the hood if you cannot safely leave the flooded area\n- Do not drive in low-lying areas where flooding may occur\n\nIf your basement floods:\n\n- Never step into a flooded basement or other room if water may be in contact with electrical outlets, appliances or cords. The water could be energized and could shock or electrocute you.\n- Stay away from trees and downed power wires.

A power outage may last from a few minutes to a few days. Prolonged power outages in extreme hot or cold weather may put your health and safety at risk.\n\nConveniences we enjoy, such as elevators and running water, may be affected during a power outage.\u00a0 Your patience is needed and appreciated while these complex issues are resolved.\n\n**Toronto Hydro Power Disruption Hotline**\u00a0number is 416-542-8000\n\nCall to report power failures, wires down, power quality problems and to speak to Customer Care.\n\n**Power outage centre on the web:** [Outages Map ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://www.torontohydro.com/outage-map) or follow us on Twitter\u00a0[**@TorontoHydro**![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://twitter.com/TorontoHydro?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)\n\n### During an Outage\n\n- Unplug all appliances (space heaters, toaster ovens, griddles, etc.) that may have been left on at the time of the outage and could ignite when they come back on\n- Unplug computers, televisions, stereos and other electronics to prevent damage caused by power surges (use surge protecting power bars where possible)\n- Turn off stove cook top and oven\n- Turn off the water to the clothes washer and dishwasher if they were in use when the power went out, if possible\n- Leave a light or radio on so you will know when power is restored\n- Never use barbecues, propane or kerosene heaters, or portable generators indoors\n- Never leave candles unattended\n\nDuring an extended power outage, your building\u2019s property management\n\nstaff or community organizations, such as the Canadian Red Cross, might\n\nvisit you at home to make sure you are safe.\n\n**Enbridge Gas Distribution**\n\nIf you smell natural gas or suspect a leak (smell of rotten eggs), leave the area and call 1-866-763-5427.\n\nDon\u2019t use your telephone or cellular phone. Call from a neighbour\u2019s phone.\n\nFuel / Natural Gas Supply Disruption\n\n\nDisruptions to the supply of fuel or natural gas can be caused by failures in the system, extreme weather, or external pressures such as financial crisis.\n\nProlonged supply disruption could have secondary effects on food supply, transportation infrastructure and many other essential services.\n\nTransportation Hazards\n\n\nRail is an efficient method of transporting people and freight over long distances. Over 194km of rail threads its way through the City of Toronto.\u00a0[Canadian National Railway ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://www.cn.ca/)\u00a0(CN) and\u00a0[Canadian Pacific Railway ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](http://www.cpr.ca/en)\u00a0(CP) are both national freight services and together own the majority of the rail network in Toronto. Rail safety is governed at the federal level through\u00a0[Transport Canada ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/menu.htm)\u00a0(TC) and the\u00a0[Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA) ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://www.otc-cta.gc.ca/eng).\n\n### Dangerous Goods Shipment Information\n\nPursuant to Transport Canada Protective Direction 36, public disclosure of danger goods shipments requires railways to provide annual aggregated dangerous goods information regarding dangerous goods shipments that move through municipalities. The City has worked to make this information available publicly and consistently.\n\n### Public Access to Information\n\nRail companies are now required to provide information to the public about the dangerous goods that are transported through the City. This is implemented through\u00a0[Protective Direction 36 ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/tdg/safety-menu-1281.html), one of the tools used by Transport Canada to regulate rail transportation.\n\nIn 2017, dangerous goods made up less than 10 per cent of the total shipments for CN (8.9 per cent) and CP in 2016 (9.71 per cent). The largest dangerous good transferred by each company was Liquefied Petroleum Gases for CN (24.9 per cent) and Alcohol, N.O.S. for CP in 2016 (28.1 per cent). The City of Toronto has taken measures to ensure information is made public to residents. To view a list of top products classified as dangerous goods for the municipality, please view the following document:\n\n[CN Rail: Public Report on Dangerous Goods Transported in Toronto 2017 ![PDF](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-pdf.svg)](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/90cc-CN-Rail-Public-Report-on-Dangerous-Goods-Transported-in-Toronto-2017.pdf \"PDF Document\")\n\n\\*This information has been made available through Transport Canada.\n\nNuclear\n\n\nToronto\u2019s neighbouring municipality of Pickering is home to the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station.\u00a0 Although the risk of a nuclear power accident is very low, the City of Toronto has a plan in place to deal with this type of event.\n\nThe Pickering Nuclear Generating Station is located at about 35 kilometers east of Toronto (City Hall) on the northern shore of Lake Ontario. It is owned and operated by\u00a0[Ontario Power Generation ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://www.opg.com/) and has been generating electricity for the province since 1971. The Pickering nuclear facility has six Canada Deuterium Uranium (CANDU) nuclear reactors. Each reactor can produce 540 megawatts of electricity. To learn more about how nuclear energy is produced at Pickering Nuclear Generating Station, visit the [Ontario Power Generation website ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://www.opg.com/).\n\nThe chance of a serious accident at a nuclear facility in Ontario is very low.\n\nVisit the\u00a0[Province of Ontario website ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](http://www.ontario.ca/law-and-safety/nuclear-incident) for more information on what to do in the event of a nuclear incident at a reactor in or around Ontario.\n\n### The Potential Hazard\n\nThere has never been a nuclear emergency \u00a0with the potential to impact the public since the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station started producing electricity. However, if an accident were to happen at the station, the most probable result would be that its effects would be confined within the station boundary and NOT affect the general public.The main hazard to people would be breathing in, and being exposed to radioactive particulates that are released as an airborne plume from the nuclear station.\n\nWhile very unlikely, there are two potential emergency scenarios that could occur:\n\n#### Controlled Release\n\nThe first is an incident which would result in a warning period of at least two days when a build-up of radioactive materials warrants a controlled release into the environment. This gives people enough time to leave the area within 10 km of the nuclear station before any radioactive materials are released out of the station.\n\nRadioactive doses to people and environmental contamination would be at low levels.\n\n#### Severe Accident\n\nAn even less likely scenario is a more severe accident involving fuel damage on one or more units\u00a0 which can cause higher levels of radioactive contamination to people and the environment. There may be little or no time for people to leave the affected area before radioactive materials are released from the nuclear station. Radiation doses would be higher. The area that could be affected may be beyond 10 km from the nuclear station. The environment could be much more contaminated with radioactivity, over larger areas and a longer period of time.\n\n### Protective Measures\n\nThe specific steps people can take to protect themselves from radioactive materials will be determined at the time of the emergency. They would be announced over television, radio and the internet by the Province of Ontario and implemented with the help of the City of Toronto, Region of Durham and other communities as required.\n\nProtective measures may be needed for people who live, study or work within 10 km of the nuclear station. In the City of Toronto, this means locations east of Morningside Avenue to the border with the City of Pickering, Steeles Avenue to Lake Ontario. This area is called the Primary Zone, and includes the City of Pickering and Town of Ajax. Protective measures that may be directed by the Province include:\n\n- Leaving the areas within the Primary Zone\n- Staying indoors\n- Taking a dose of Potassium Iodide but only when directed by the Province\n\n_When taken at the right time_, Potassium Iodide pills prevent or reduce the absorption of radioactive Iodine into the thyroid gland.\n\nPotassium Iodide pills\u00a0_do not protect_\u00a0other parts of the body from any other radiation.\n\n**Special care is required if Potassium Iodide pills are given to young children. Please consult your family doctor for more information.**\n\nDuring a nuclear emergency, Potassium Iodide pills will be available at Reception-Evacuee Centres that will be set up at various locations in the Greater Toronto Area.\n\nIf you are outside the 10km zone, but within 50km of a nuclear station, you are eligible for free KI pills. Although you will not be receiving KI Pills as part of the eligible zone mailout, you can [order the pills on-line ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://preparetobesafe.ca/order).\n\nMore information is available at [www.preparetobesafe.ca ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](http://www.preparetobesafe.ca/) or by contacting\u00a0 Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000.\n\n### \u2018Red Page\u2019 \u2013 Nuclear Emergency Information\n\nPublic safety has been a goal and success story for the Canadian nuclear industry. Canadian reactors are built and operated safely. While the chance of a major nuclear emergency is highly unlikely, it makes sense to know what to do if it becomes necessary. For your information and safety, a \u2018Red Page\u2019 has been developed by Emergency Management Ontario, the City of Toronto, Durham Region, the City of Pickering, the Town of Clarington and Ontario Power Generation. It provides instructions on what to do in the event of an emergency at Pickering Nuclear.\n\nThe main message to remember is: Go. Listen. Follow.\n\n- **Go**\u00a0inside and turn on your radio or television\n- **Listen**\u00a0to media reports for instructions from the Province on what to do\n- **Follow**\u00a0the directions provided by the Province\n\nThe Red Page is part of a public awareness program for residents and businesses located in the eastern parts of Toronto, within 10 km of Pickering Nuclear, near the Pickering border. The Red Page includes telephone numbers and internet links for more information. Please print this Red Page [(English version) ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/9041-red-pages-submission-e.pdf \"PDF Document\") \\|\u00a0[(French version) ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/9098-red-pages-submission-f.pdf \"PDF Document\")\u00a0and keep it with your telephone directory, so that you can find it easily.\n\nThe Red Page is also available from the City of Toronto in Chinese, Farsi, Punjabi, Tamil and Urdu. Please call 311 for translation.\n\nThe City of Toronto, Province of Ontario and OPG work together to continually improve emergency plans. Staff from police, fire, emergency medical services, public health, transit and volunteer organizations routinely train together to deal with nuclear and other emergencies.\n\n[Emergency Management Ontario ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://www.emergencymanagementontario.ca/english/home.html)\n\n[Toronto Nuclear Emergency Response Plan (TNERP) Aug 20, 2020 ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/972e-TNERP20aug2020approved-Web-Version-FINAL.pdf \"PDF Document\")\n\nFire and Explosion\n\n\nFires and explosions can cause extensive damage to property through smoke and burn damage. They can commonly result in evacuations of large numbers of people, closure of roads, homes or businesses, and even water damage from sprinkler systems or fire hoses.\n\nHigh-rise buildings are designed to be more fire-safe than the average single-family dwelling. Floors and ceilings are constructed with fire-resistant materials and are separated into fire compartments. However, in the event of a fire, there are a number of things you can do to protect your family and your property.\n\n### Preventive Measures:\n\n- Install smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors throughout your home and outside all bedrooms\n- Regularly check the batteries and replace twice each year\n- Prepare and practice your escape plan by identifying all exits and a place outside your home for family members to meet if you have to evacuate quickly\n\n### In the Event of Fire:\n\n- Sound fire alarm and alert others\n- Leave the building via the nearest exit, closing all doors behind you\n- **Do not use the elevator**\n- Call 9-1-1 (don\u2019t assume this has been done)\n- If you cannot leave the building, stay close to the floor and cover your mouth and nose to avoid inhaling smoke\n- Move to the nearest window or balcony\n- Wave a piece of cloth to attract attention from emergency services personnel\n- Meet the firefighters when they arrive and tell them where the fire is\n\nHazard Identification and Risk Assessment\n\n\nThe City of Toronto is vulnerable to numerous hazards. The hazards can be natural such as extreme weather, human caused such as a cyber-attack, or technological such as utility failures and power failures. It\u2019s our role to assess the risks, and determine which hazards are most likely to result in an emergency. As part of our legislated requirement, Toronto Emergency Management undertakes a comprehensive Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment.\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=jdeyy0pn2un9)\n\nPCFET0NUWVBFIGh0bWw PGJvZHk 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",

It will work\u00a0 to bring about a safe Toronto that promotes and celebrates the well-being and resilience of all residents by:\n\n- expanding the definition of community safety beyond crime or policing to include well-being\n- redefining what trauma means and deepening the ability of the City and its partners to be informed by it and respond to it\n- enhancing our ability to act early and advance preventive approaches\n- developing innovative mechanisms to use multi-sector data to inform decision making and integrate investments\n- implementing an effective multi-sector governance structure that brings our critical partners into co-ordinated leadership and action\n- committing to a long-term vision of community safety and well-being and a comprehensive plan to realize it.\n\n[SafeTO ![PDF](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-pdf.svg)](https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2021/ex/bgrd/backgroundfile-168551.pdf \"PDF Document\") will drive 26 priority actions across seven strategic goals: reduce vulnerability; reduce violence; advance truth and reconciliation; promote healing and justice; invest in people; invest in neighbourhoods, and drive collaboration and accountability. It provides a roadmap for how the City and social systems that serve Torontonians, such as community services, healthcare systems, education systems, justice systems, police and businesses, can work collaboratively across different sectors and across governments to support community safety and well-being.\n\nExpand All SafeTO: A Community Safety & Well-Being Plan accordion panelsCollapse All SafeTO: A Community Safety & Well-Being Plan accordion panels\n\n## Community Safety and Policing Act\n\n[The Community Safety and Policing Act, 2019, S.O. 2019, c. 1, Sched. 1 Part XVI ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/19c01) mandates every municipality across Ontario to prepare and adopt a Community Safety and Well-being Plan by July 2021.\n\n### Legislative Requirements\n\n#### Establish a Multi-Level Advisory Committee\n\nMunicipalities will form a multi-sectoral advisory committee comprised of representation from the police service board and other local service providers in health/mental health, education, community/social services and children/youth services.\n\n#### Consultation\n\nThe Municipality will consult the advisory committee, affected communities and those that serve them on the prioritization of risk factors and to identify strategies to address them.\n\n#### Outcomes Framework\n\nThe Municipality will use relevant data to identify and prioritize risk factors that contribute to crime, victimization and community safety and well-being; and will set out measurable outcomes that the strategies are intended to produce\n\n#### Alignment with Police Service Board\n\nPolice Service Boards will implement business plans that align with and further the goals of the Municipality\u2019s CSWB Plan.\n\n#### Publish Completed Plan\n\nThe Municipality will report on and publish the CSWB plan.\n\n#### Review Plan\n\nThe plan will be revised within a four-year time frame.\n\n## Community Safety and Well-Being Planning Framework\n\nOur work leverages the Community Safety and Well-Being Planning Framework developed by the Ministry of Solicitor General in partnership with a broad range of sectors including the City. The Community Safety and Well-Being Planning Framework includes:\n\n### Social Development (Upstream)\n\n- Social development requires long-term, multi-disciplinary efforts and investments to improve the social determinants of health and thereby reduce the probability of harm and victimization. Appropriate investment in social development will experience the social benefits of addressing root causes of crime and disorder.\n\n### Prevention (Midstream)\n\n- Prevention involves proactively implementing evidence-based situational measures, policies or programs to reduce locally identified priority risks to community safety and well-being before they result in crime, victimization and/or harm.\n- Opportunities to learn from prevention efforts can advise on strategic investment in social development\n\n### Risk Intervention (Downstream)\n\n- Risk intervention involves multiple sectors working together to address and/or interrupt escalating situations where there is an elevated risk of harm\n- What is learned by mobilizing risk intervention can inform how investments and strategies are deployed in the prevention and social development areas.\n\n### Incident Response\n\n- Immediate and reactionary responses that may involve a sense of urgency in response to crime or safety.\n- Initiatives in this area alone cannot be relied upon to increase community safety and well-being.\n\n## Prioritized Challenges\n\nThe following areas have emerged from staff review of existing engagement and consultation data and reflect key principles in our approach to the SafeTO work \u2013 build on the existing community and institutional wisdom. It is important to note that, all of the prioritized challenges are interrelated and that there will be overlap in how the City responds to these areas.\n\n### Prioritized Challenge \\#1 \u2013 Community Trauma\n\n#### Rationale\n\n- Communities and neighborhoods that experience higher levels of inequities and/or experience higher levels of violence are most vulnerable to becoming traumatized. Unaddressed trauma can manifest in physical, emotional, and psychological harm creating negative impacts on community well-being, health and safety. Systemic racism and inequity are primary contributing factors of trauma.\n- There is growing evidence that the experience of trauma, multi-generational or intergenerational racial trauma, and early trauma as a result of adverse childhood experiences can cause life-long harm, poor health outcomes and in some cases perpetuate violence.\n- Community consultations amplified the need for the City to prioritize addressing trauma. Recognizing trauma as a contributing root cause and directly addressing the impact of trauma on individuals and communities through culturally responsive approaches can help facilitate recovery from the consequences and manifestations of trauma.\n\n#### Examples\n\n- Inter-generational and multi-generational trauma as a result of historic harms experienced by Indigenous peoples are often unacknowledged or unaddressed and can result in further traumatization as a result of negative interactions with government systems.\n- In recent years, Toronto has experienced attacks including the Yonge Street van attack and the Danforth shooting which resulted in mass casualties and victimization. Further, some communities experience more frequent exposure to community violence or adverse community experiences disproportionately. The compounding impact of these events can traumatize individuals and entire communities.\n- Preliminary data from the Office of the Chief Coroner for Ontario demonstrates there was a record-high number of confirmed opioid toxicity deaths in Toronto in 2020, with a total of 521 fatalities. This represents a 78 percent increase from 2019 and a 280 percent increase from 2015. There has been a notable increase in drug-related deaths since the start of the COVID-19 emergency. Substance use is often driven by trauma, and the increase in deaths has had devastating impacts on the loved ones of those lost and the frontline workers who supported them.\n\n### Prioritized Challenge \\#2 \u2013 Community Violence\n\n#### Rationale\n\n- Community violence \u2014 including gun violence, gender-based and intimate partner violence \u2014 has been on the rise in Toronto and was declared a public health issue by the Toronto Board of Health in 2019.\n- The traumatic impact of gun violence in communities is not only experienced by individuals, it is experienced by communities which can contribute to negative long-term health outcomes and can be a contributing factor to the propensity to commit violence.\n- There have been calls to strategically mobilize short-term and long-term actions in coordination with multi-sector partners, community leaders, and residents to interrupt the immediate risks of community violence and continuously work to prevent it.\n\n#### Examples\n\n- As of May 19, 2021, there have been 119 shootings in Toronto resulting in 46 injuries and 12 people losing their lives.\n- Incidents of gender-based and intimate partner violence are also increasing in Toronto, particularly through the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n### Prioritized Challenge \\#3 \u2013 Harm Reduction and Victimization\n\n#### Rationale\n\n- Experiencing both immediate and life-long harms or repeated victimization can be a risk factor of complex conditions that threaten community safety (e.g. mental health crisis, substance use, human trafficking, and hate crimes). Continued exposure to such harms can negatively impact the social determinants of health and further exacerbate the risk to equity-deserving communities.\n- Advancing policies and programs to reduce harm and victimization and further understand vulnerability will ensure individuals and communities have access to resources and supports such as victim/witness, psycho-social and other relevant supports that promote community healing while also beginning to address the root causes of these harms.\n- Vulnerability extends to instances of acquired brain injuries and developmental disabilities; the lack of understanding of these issues combined with the lack of appropriate supports presents an increased risk of engagement with the criminal justice system.\n\n#### Examples\n\n- The number of reported hate-related incidents in Toronto has increased by 51 percent in 2020 with clear calls from the community for the City to prioritize efforts to address systemic racism and inequity.\n- Mental health calls to police are occurring at a rate of approximately 85 per day, and 76 percent of all FOCUS Toronto situations respond to mental health issues.\n- Acquired and Traumatic Brain Injuries are another notable concern given their prevalence among populations experiencing homelessness; a study conducted in 2008 found that of 904 people experiencing homelessness in Toronto, 53 percent had sustained at least one traumatic brain injury.\n- In 2020, Toronto Paramedic Services responded to 3,861 suspected overdose calls, including 268 calls involving death. This is a 90 percent increase in the number of suspected overdose deaths attended by Toronto Paramedic Services. The criminalization of people who use drugs and limited access to harm reduction services, including safer supply, contributes to the increase of drug-related overdoses and death.\n\n### Prioritized Challenge \\#4 \u2013 Injustice\n\n#### Rationale\n\n- The reliance on an enforcement lens continues to perpetuate the over-representation of Indigenous, Black and equity-deserving communities in the criminal justice system. There is a lack of consistency in terms of the application of a community justice lens in the approaches that address the root causes of community safety and well-being.\n- Restorative practices are an approach to justice that focus on addressing the harm caused by crime while holding the offender responsible for their actions, through providing an opportunity for those directly affected by the crime (victims, offenders and communities) to identify and address their needs in the aftermath of a crime in a culturally specific approach.\n- Reintegration is the support given to offenders during their re-entry into society following incarceration. It can include treatment, restorative justice and suitable community-based supports or treatment.\n- There are clear calls from the community to mobilize culturally responsive restorative practices and reintegration approaches that embody cultural identity and tradition as forms of intervention within communities.\n\n#### Example\n\n- Nearly one out of every 15 young Black men in Ontario experienced jail time, compared to one out of about every 70 young white men, and incarcerated Black people were more likely to live in low-income neighbourhoods. A siloed approach to community safety that results in an over-emphasis on enforcement has been shown to perpetuate the over-representation of Indigenous, Black and equity-deserving communities in the criminal justice system.\n- Between September 2018 and October 2019, Toronto\u2019s Metro West Court\u00adhouse received approximately 306 youth cases from 23 Division and 312 from 31 Division. Taken together, 23 and 31 Divisions account for more than 40 per cent of all youth cases seen at the Metro West Courthouse.\n- Despite making up only 4.1 per cent of the population in Ontario under age 15, Indigenous children represent approximately 30 per cent of foster children.\n\n## SafeTO Goals and Priority Actions\n\nBelow is a list of the SafeTO goals and priority actions.

2022 Work Plan\n\nThe [SafeTO Implementation Plan ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](http://app.toronto.ca/tmmis/viewAgendaItemHistory.do?item=2022.EX29.2) focuses on seven goals that will be achieved through 26 actions. As part of year one, the plan will focus on building a strong foundation which includes:\n\n- The introduction of an alternative crisis support service model that is community-led, client-centred, trauma-informed and focused on reducing harm, which will be delivered through [four community pilots](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/get-involved/community/policing-reform/?accordion=community-crisis-support-service-pilots).\n- The establishment of a Toronto Office to Prevent Gun Violence, through engagement with appropriate partners, to work with the community to enhance coordination of gun violence prevention and intervention efforts.\n- Better support for victims and communities impacted by violence, by enhancing the [Community Crisis Response Program](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/public-safety-alerts/community-safety-programs/community-crisis-response-program/) and community partnerships that provide trauma-informed, culturally responsive supports.\n- The creation of a multi-sector data centre for the purpose of informing real-time policy development and service planning.\n\nThrough the implementation plan, the City will also lead inter-governmental efforts \u2014 identifying investment priorities, creating long-term partnerships focused on shared outcomes, identifying opportunities to better coordinate and align existing investments and affecting policy change \u2014 as well as engage the community through formalizing the SafeTO Advisory Table. The group will be made up of City Divisions and Agencies, and will also include multiple sectors, grass-roots groups, and community leaders representing several core issues.\n\n## Engagement\n\nFrom November 2020 to April 2021, City staff engaged in an extensive community consultation process. Engagement included population-specific, issue-specific, and geographic-based consultations as well as internal discussions with 18 City divisions, agencies and corporations.\n\nCommunity consultations were targeted to stakeholders providing services related to or directly experiencing challenges related to community safety and well-being. This was complemented by engagement with subject matter experts, residents and community thought-leaders. In total, more than 2,500 stakeholders were engaged, with written submissions also accepted.\n\nA public survey was available from March 1 to 15, 2021 that received an additional 1,500 responses. A [summary of the SafeTO consultation findings ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2021/ex/bgrd/backgroundfile-168553.pdf \"PDF Document\") is available online.\n\n## SafeTO Collaborative Analytics and Learning Environment (SCALE)\n\nThe SafeTO Collaborative Analytics and Learning Environment (SCALE) is a collaborative platform that allows the City and partners to share data, identify effective interventions, and communicate lessons to advance prevention-focused safety outcomes. SCALE\u2019s work focuses on prototyping, piloting, and scaling approaches, all grounded in responsible data use. This initiative is a crucial contributor to the ongoing enhancement of safety outcomes, engaging municipal partners like the TTC, Toronto Police Service, University of Toronto, community organizations, and federal partners like Statistics Canada.\n\nAs part of [City council\u2019s mandate](https://secure.toronto.ca/council/agenda-item.do?item=2021.EX25.4) SCALE is a priority action in the SafeTO Community Safety and Well-Being Plan to develop a comprehensive strategy to share, integrate and analyze data across multiple institutions for the purpose of informing real-time policy development and service planning.\n\nIn 2023, SCALE launched the Community Safety and Wellbeing on Transit Dashboard\u00a0[Community Safety & Wellbeing on Transit.](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/transit-community-safety-data/)\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=uk47l28prtfh)",

        "markdown": "![City of Toronto](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/themes/cot/img/logo-print.svg)\n\n# Carbon Monoxide Alarms\n\nIn Ontario, more than 80 per cent of injuries and deaths from Carbon Monoxide (CO) occur in the home. We want to make sure everyone is safe from CO. Install CO alarms, and do everything you can to prevent CO in your home in the first place. Beat the silent killer: Prevent Carbon Monoxide (CO) in your home.\n\nLandlord/Tenant Responsibilities\n\n\nLandlords must:\n\n- Install carbon monoxide alarms in accordance with the Ontario Fire Code\n- Maintain carbon monoxide alarms in operating condition\n- Maintain primary and secondary power supplies that serve carbon monoxide alarms\n- Provide the tenant a copy of the manufacturer\u2019s maintenance instructions\n- The same is true for [smoke alarms](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/public-safety-alerts/safety-tips-prevention/safety-equipment-devices/smoke-alarms/)\n\nTenants must:\n\n- Not disable the carbon monoxide alarm\n- Notify the landlord as soon as you are aware the carbon monoxide alarm in the unit is disconnected, not operating or the operation is impaired\n- The same is true for [smoke alarms](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/public-safety-alerts/safety-tips-prevention/safety-equipment-devices/smoke-alarms/)\n\nWhat do tenants do if the landlord does not provide working carbon monoxide alarms as required?\n\n- Call 311 for a referral to Toronto Fire Services and a Fire Inspector will attend\n\nThe penalties for violating these requirements under the\u00a0_Fire Protection and Prevention Act (FPPA)_\u00a0are:\n\n- $50,000 and/or 1 year in jail for an individual\n- $100,000 for a corporation\n\nCarbon Monoxide Alarms in Your House\n\n\nIf your home has a fuel-burning appliance, a fireplace or an attached garage, you must have a working CO alarm adjacent to each sleeping area of the home. For added protection, install a carbon monoxide alarm on every storey of the home according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Fuel-burning appliances can include furnaces, hot water heaters, gas or wood fireplaces, portable fuel-burning heaters and generators, barbeques, stoves and vehicles.\n\nCarbon Monoxide Alarms in Your Condo or Apartment\n\n\nThe Ontario Fire Code requires that in condo and apartment buildings with a service room, CO alarms must be installed in the service room and adjacent to each sleeping area of all homes above, below and beside the service room. In condo or apartment buildings that have a garage, CO alarms must be installed adjacent to each sleeping area of all homes above, below and beside the garage.\n\nWhat is Carbon Monoxide?\n\n\n- CO is known as the silent killer because it is an invisible, tasteless and odourless gas that can be deadly.\n- CO is produced when fuels such as propane, gasoline, natural gas, heating oil or wood do not burn completely in fuel-burning appliances and devices such as furnaces, gas or wood fireplaces, hot water heaters, stoves, barbeques, portable fuel-burning heaters and generators and vehicles.\n\nPrevent Carbon Monoxide in Your Home\n\n\nEnsure all fuel-burning appliances in your home are inspected annually. Visit [COSafety.ca ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](http://cosafety.ca/) to find a registered contractor near you.\n\n- Check that all outside appliance vents are not blocked.\n- Never use a portable fuel-burning appliance inside (i.e. barbeques, portable heaters and generators).\n\nKnow the Symptoms of Carbon Monoxide Poisoning\n\n\n- Exposure to CO can cause flu-like symptoms such as headaches, nausea, dizziness, as well as confusion, drowsiness, loss of consciousness and death.\n- If your CO alarm sounds, and you or other occupants suffer from symptoms of CO poisoning, get everyone out of the home immediately. Then call 9-1-1 or your local emergency services number from outside the building.\n- If your CO alarm sounds, and no one is suffering from symptoms of CO poisoning, check to see if the battery needs replacing, or the alarm has reached its \u201cend-of-life\u201d before calling 9-1-1.\n\nKnow the Sound of Your Carbon Monoxide Alarm\n\n\n- Your CO alarm sounds different than your smoke alarm. Test both alarms monthly and make sure everyone in your home knows the difference between the two alarm sounds.\n- Don\u2019t be confused by the sound of your CO alarm\u2019s low-battery warning.

By providing immediate supports, the CCRP mobilizes local resources to address individual/group needs, coordinates community debriefings and facilitates information sharing. Long-term supports offered by the program include establishing training and education sessions, facilitating community safety audits, and fostering the development of innovative, community safety projects.\n\nExpand All Community Crisis Response Program (CCRP) accordion panelsCollapse All Community Crisis Response Program (CCRP) accordion panels\n\n## About the Community Crisis Response Program\n\nThe Community Crisis Response Program (CCRP) works across the city of Toronto in partnership with community members, agencies, and internal City divisions to enhance community safety and wellbeing.\n\nThe CCRP team supports communities with the development of safety networks that create neighbourhood strategies which focus on Crisis Intervention, Crisis Prevention, and Crisis Preparation.\n\n- Crisis Intervention: providing support to communities after a violent or traumatic incident.\n- Crisis Prevention: supporting education, development of strategies and methods and making systemic policy recommendations that may prevent future violent incidents.\n- Crisis Preparation: developing local safety networks which can provide cohesive and collaborative responses to critical incidents.\n\nCCRP works with communities to identify concerns and develop localized strategies including the development of a coordinated community crisis response protocol.\n\nWhen communities have been impacted by violent and traumatic incidents, the CCRP further supports communities with the recovery and healing process.\n\nViolent and traumatic incidents include: shootings, shots fired, stabbings/slashings, swarming, community conflicts, gun/gang related activity, and raids/ execution of major search warrants.\n\n### Response Protocol\n\nThe CCRP is not a first response program. Members of the public are reminded to call 911 in emergency situations. The program is automatically activated 12-72 hours after a violent incident occurs.\n\nEach day, the CCRP staff gather and receive information on critical incidents from the police, news media, municipal services, community organizations and local place-based networks. CCRP staff communicate with community stakeholders to arrange needs assessments for crisis response activities and to mobilize supports where necessary\n\n## CCRP Team\n\n**Management**\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| Stephen Linton<br>Manager<br>[Stephen.Linton@toronto.ca](mailto:Stephen.Linton@toronto.ca)<br>437-238-9521 | Kevin Bourne<br>Supervisor<br>[Kevin.Bourne@toronto.ca](mailto:Kevin.Bourne@toronto.ca)<br>416-677-5094 |\n\n**Community Crisis Response Program**\n\nThe Community Crisis Response Program (CCRP) works across Toronto providing support and resources to communities impacted by violent and traumatic incidents.

Most fatal fires happen at night when people are sleeping. A working smoke alarm will detect smoke and sound to alert you. [The Ontario Fire Code ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/070213) requires every home to have one or more working smoke alarm(s). Find out more about the smoke alarm fire safety campaign below.\n\nSmoke Alarm Fire Safety Campaign\n\n\nThe Fire Safety Campaign for Single-Family Homes is reminding all residents that a residential fire could mean life or death. Make sure your smoke alarms are working.\n\n![Smoke alarm on ceiling with smoke and text beneath](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/937c-City-of-TorontoFire-Campaign12Dec22web2-500x500.jpg)\n\nThis campaign originated from research conducted by Toronto Fire Services demonstrating that in the last 5 years, 59% of fires in single family residential homes across the city did not have a working smoke alarm.\n\nThe campaign also provides a QR code or link for residents to [embed reminder dates](https://www.toronto.ca/ext/digital_comm/fire/alarmcheck.ics) in their mobile phone or computer calendars to change their smoke alarm batteries every six months.\n\n![Smoke alarm on ceiling with text and smoke below](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/9399-City-of-TorontoFire-CampaignWeb1-500x500.jpg)\n\nAdditional messages/safety tips include:\n\n- Ensure you have a working smoke alarm on every level of your home and outside all sleeping areas\n- Change your smoke alarm batteries every 6 months\n- Smoke alarms don\u2019t last forever, replace them every 10 years\n- Test your smoke alarms monthly to make sure they work\n\nChoose the Right Alarm\n\n\nThere are many different types of smoke alarms to choose from. Smoke alarms can be electrically connected, battery-operated or both. When replacing a smoke alarm you must replace it with the same type (battery, electrically connected, or both).\n\nInstall More than One\n\n\nSmoke alarms must be on every level of your home and near each sleeping area. Remember to replace alarms that are more than 10 years old. Smoke alarms don\u2019t last forever. Depending on the age of your home smoke alarms may also be located **inside** each bedroom as well.\n\nWhere to Install Smoke Alarms?\n\n\nBecause smoke rises, it is recommended that you place the alarms on the ceiling. Avoid ceilings near bathrooms, heating appliances, windows and ceiling fans. Always follow the manufacturers instructions when installing smoke alarms.\n\nTest Your Alarm\n\n\nTest your smoke alarms monthly by pressing the test button and listening for the alarm.\n\nReplace Batteries Regularly\n\n\nWhen a smoke alarms warning beeps sound, replace your battery immediately, never wait. If you have regular batteries it is recommended to change them twice a year at the same time you change your clocks for daylight savings. Some new smoke alarms come with a 10 year sealed battery and do not require you to make battery changes.\n\nMaintain Alarms\n\n\nPrevent dust from clogging your smoke alarms by gently vacuuming them with a soft brush every six months. Never vacuum electrically connected alarms unless you shut off the power. Test each unit when finished.\n\nPrepare & Practice\n\n\nMake a [home escape plan](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/public-safety-alerts/safety-tips-prevention/home-high-rise-school-workplace-safety/home-fire-escape-planning/). Draw a floor plan showing how you and your family would escape a fire in your home. Look for two ways out of each room and have a pre-arranged meeting place outside. Regularly practice with every member of your home. After everyone is outside, call 9-1-1 from a safe location.\n\nLandlord/Tenant Responsibilities\n\n\nLandlords must:\n\n- Install smoke alarms in accordance with the Ontario Fire Code\n- Maintain smoke alarms in operating condition\n- Maintain primary and secondary power supplies that serve smoke alarms\n- Provide the tenant a copy of the manufacturer\u2019s maintenance instructions\n- The same is true for [carbon monoxide alarms](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/public-safety-alerts/safety-tips-prevention/safety-equipment-devices/carbon-monoxide-alarms/)\n\nTenants must:\n\n- Not disable the smoke alarm\n- Notify the landlord as soon as you are aware the smoke alarm in the unit is disconnected, not operating or the operation is impaired\n- The same is true for [carbon monoxide alarms](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/public-safety-alerts/safety-tips-prevention/safety-equipment-devices/carbon-monoxide-alarms/)\n\nWhat do tenants do if the landlord does not provide working smoke alarms as required?\n\n- Call 311 for a referral to Toronto Fire Services and a Fire Inspector will attend\n\nThe penalties for violating these requirements under the\u00a0_Fire Protection and Prevention Act (FPPA)_\u00a0are:\n\n- $50,000 and/or 1 year in jail for an individual\n- $100,000 for a corporation\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=y1w56ojmsjan)\n\nPCFET0NUWVBFIGh0bWw PGJvZHk 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",

All children are different \u2013 one child may need closer supervision than another.\n- Always watch young children when they are eating.\n- Always know where your children play and that they are being supervised.\n- Never leave your child alone near a window, balcony or fire escape.\n- Never leave an infant or young child unattended. Always keep a hand on them when on a surface above the floor, a change table, or in the bathtub.\n- Ensure all potentially harmful substances, including medications, alcohol and [cannabis](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/health-wellness-care/health-programs-advice/cannabis-and-your-health/), are safely stored and avoid using any substances when caring for children.\n\nHow much supervision is needed? Here are five questions to ask yourself:\n\n- What is my child able to do?\n- How active is my child?\n- How impulsive is my child?\n- How well does my child follow rules?\n- How safe is the environment?\n\n## Create and Follow Family Safety Rules\n\n- When your child is able to understand, make family safety rules together such as holding an adult\u2019s hand when crossing the street or playing where an adult can see them.\n- Help your child understand why safety rules are important and need to be followed.\n- Give your child reminders of what the safety rules are.\n- Praise your child when they play safe and follow the rules.\n- Your child learns by watching you; be a safety role model.\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=wmfx6ehkf34u)\n\nPCFET0NUWVBFIGh0bWw PGJvZHk 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",

It is essential for caregivers and students to talk about fire and life safety. Whether returning to school or leaving home for the first time, a discussion about good fire safety practices can help to ensure this exciting time in a students life is not marred by a fire tragedy.\n\nExpand All Student Accommodations Fire Safety accordion panelsCollapse All Student Accommodations Fire Safety accordion panels\n\n## Living Safely 101 - What Every Student Should Know to Prevent Fire\n\n#### Look While You Cook\n\nStay in the kitchen when cooking \u2013 especially if using oil or high temperatures. If a pot catches fire, have a proper-fitting pot lid handy to slide over the pot and turn off the stove. Cooking requires constant attention. Distractions like televisions, cell phones, or computers can lead to a tragic cooking fire.\n\n#### Candle With Care\n\nIf you use candles in your room or apartment, keep them away from anything that can burn and place them in a safe, sturdy holder with a glass shade or hurricane chimney. Place them where they cannot be knocked over and blow them out when leaving the room.\n\n#### Keep An Eye On Excessive Drinkers\n\nAlcohol is a common factor in many fire fatalities involving cooking and smoking. Be aware of roommates and friends who have been drinking excessively, especially if they are cooking or smoking.\n\n#### Smoke Outside\n\nEstablish rules for smokers. If you permit smoking inside, use large, sturdy ashtrays that can\u2019t be easily tipped over. Ashtrays should be emptied into a metal container not the garbage can. Check around furniture cushions after people have been smoking, especially if they have been drinking.\n\n#### Use Electricity Wisely\n\nToasters, coffeemakers and microwaves should be plugged directly into an outlet. If you must use an extension cord, buy one that is the correct gauge for the appliance and has a CSA or ULC approval mark on the label. CSA or ULC approved power bars may be used for stereo equipment, computers and lights.\n\n#### Clear the Clutter\n\nKeep things that burn away from heat sources like stovetops, space heaters and electronic equipment. Tea towels and paper too close to burners can catch fire. Keep space heaters at least one metre away from bedding, furniture and curtains.\n\n#### Working Smoke Alarms\n\nIt\u2019s the Law: Your room or apartment must have working smoke alarms. Test them monthly and notify the landlord immediately if they\u2019re not working. Dead batteries must be replaced right away. Nuisance alarms can be avoided by making sure smoke alarms are not located too close to the kitchen or bathroom. Consider getting a smoke alarm with a hush feature. Smoke alarms should be checked after any extended absence such as Christmas break and reading week. Never tamper with or disable a smoke alarm.\n\n#### Carbon Monoxide Alarms\n\nOntario law requires all homes/apartments to have a working carbon monoxide alarm outside all sleeping areas if there is a fuel-burning appliance or fireplace in the home/apartment. If the building has a service room or a garage, carbon monoxide alarms must be installed outside each sleeping area of all apartment units above, below and beside the service room or garage. If there is a service room, a carbon monoxide alarm also must be installed in the service room. Contact the local fire department for more information.\n\n#### Plan To Escape\n\nKnow two ways out of your room or apartment in case of fire. Identify all exits and make sure you can use them. If you live in a high-rise, familiarize yourself with the building\u2019s fire safety plan. If you discover fire, call the fire department from a safe location outside.\n\n#### Be Equipped\n\nTo stay safe, all students should put together a package that includes a smoke alarm and carbon monoxide alarm, a battery powered lantern or flashlight and radio, extra batteries and a CSA or ULC approved power bar.\n\n## A Parent\u2019s Guide to Finding Fire-safe Accommodation\n\n#### Smoke Alarms\n\nIt is the law in Ontario to have working smoke alarms on every storey and outside all sleeping areas. The law applies to single family, semi-detached, town homes and apartments (including basement apartments), whether owner-occupied or rented. Rooming houses have specific regulations about smoke alarms or fire alarm systems. In addition to smoke alarms within each unit or suite, apartment buildings and student residences operated by the school may also have a building fire alarm system. Make sure the landlord, administrator or superintendent identifies and explains the fire alarm and detection features in the building and unit.\n\n#### Carbon Monoxide Alarms\n\nOntario law requires all homes/apartments to have a working carbon monoxide alarm outside all sleeping areas if there is a fuel-burning appliance or fireplace in the home/apartment. If the building has a service room or a garage, carbon monoxide alarms must be installed outside each sleeping area of all apartment units above, below and beside the service room or garage. If there is a service room, a carbon monoxide alarm also must be installed in the service room. Contact the local fire department for more information.\n\n#### Fire Separations\n\nStudents often find accommodation in older homes that have been converted to apartments or rooming houses. At the time of the conversion, a building permit should have been obtained to ensure that fire safety features such as proper exits and fire separations between units are provided. Ask the owner if the property complies with the Building Code and Fire Code and to explain the fire safety features.\n\n#### Exits\n\nIt is important to consider how people will escape from a room or apartment in an emergency. Every room or apartment requires adequate exits that will permit unobstructed escape from the building. Make sure to ask the landlord or superintendent to identify all of the designated exits. All windows and doors should open fully and easily. Stairways and hallways must not be used for storage as this can pose serious fire safety hazards. Furniture and other obstacles can physically block exits and may fill hallways or stairways with smoke if they catch fire. This practice must be strictly avoided.\n\n#### Fire Escape Plans\n\nIn a fire emergency, everyone must know what to do and where to go. Large apartment buildings and student residence buildings require a fire safety plan, which informs the occupants about emergency procedures. Ask the building administrator or superintendent to explain the procedures in the fire safety plan.\n\nSmaller apartment buildings and houses that have been converted to apartments or lodging rooms may not have a fire safety plan, however its a good idea to ensure there are two ways out of the unit. The alternate way out can be a window that can be safely exited in an emergency.\n\n#### Security\n\nSome property owners install bars on windows as a security measure. While this may seem appealing from a security point of view, it can prevent students from escaping in an emergency situation. Security bars on windows should be equipped with a quick-opening device on the inside so the bars can be removed quickly.\n\n#### Electrical Safety\n\nMany buildings offering lodging to students are older homes that may not have upgraded wiring. Outlets in bathrooms or within one metre of the kitchen sink should be the Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI) type. Consider the number and location of electrical outlets in the room or apartment. There should be enough outlets so that appliances such as lamps, computer equipment and stereos can be operated without the use of extension cords. If extension cords cant be avoided, use multi-outlet power bars that are approved and provide surge protection and a circuit breaker. Make sure that electrical cords of any kind are not concealed under carpets or rugs where they can be easily damaged. Avoid overloaded circuits and octopus wiring.\n\n#### For more information\n\nContact the administration offices of the college or university. They will frequently maintain a registry of available accommodation for students. Call the local fire department to determine if the building has been inspected for Fire Code compliance.\n\n## Fire Safety Basics for Student Accommodation\n\n#### Cooking\n\nCooking is the number one cause of home fires in Ontario. If the student\u2019s accommodation has cooking facilities, there are some basic fire safety rules they must follow to prevent cooking fires:\n\n- A stovetop fire can start in a flash, so stay in the kitchen when something is cooking on the stove.\n- Keep all combustible items a safe distance away from the stove. This includes tea towels, wooden or plastic spoons and paper towels.\n- Keep a pot lid near the stove to smother flames if a fire starts in a pot.\n\n#### Candles\n\nThe use of candles is becoming more and more popular, especially among young people. To prevent candle fires:\n\n- Use tea lights or votive candles in non-combustible containers as they are generally a safer choice than tapers.\n- Place the candles in a location where they cant be knocked over or come in contact with combustible items.\n- Blow out all candles before leaving the room or going to bed.\n\n#### Space Heaters\n\nThe central heating systems in older accommodation is often supplemented with space heaters. To prevent heating fires:\n\n- Keep the space heater at least one metre away from anything that can burn, such as paper, bedding, furniture and curtains.\n- Turn off the space heater before going out or going to bed.\n\n#### Social Gatherings\n\nParties are as much a part of student life as attending classes. While most student parties are harmless fun, the consumption of alcohol combined with cooking or smoking can create a serious fire risk. To minimize the risk of fires during or after parties:\n\n- Avoid over-crowding. The more people attending the party, the easier it is to lose control of the situation.\n- Encourage guests to smoke outside. Consider putting up no smoking signs that direct guests to an outside smoking area.\n- Refrain from burning candles during parties. They can easily be knocked over or ignite nearby combustibles, unnoticed.\n\n#### Smoking\n\nFires caused by smoking can be deadly. Even if they don\u2019t smoke themselves, chances are the student will have friends that do. To prevent smoking fires:\n\n- Encourage smokers to go outside.\n- Keep large, deep ashtrays on hand that will reduce the risk of ashes and cigarette butts falling onto rugs or upholstery.\n- Allow ashes to cool completely before disposing.\n\n#### Electrical Equipment\n\nOverloaded circuits and octopus wiring are dangerous electrical hazards that can be avoided. To prevent fires caused by electrical equipment:\n\n- Use an approved power bar with a circuit breaker and surge protector to plug in computer and stereo equipment.\n- Avoid the use of extension cords as permanent wiring.\n- Make sure electrical cords are not concealed under carpets or rugs where they can be easily damaged.\n\n#### Smoke alarms\n\nIf a fire does occur, it is critical that the dwelling have working smoke alarms to alert occupants as soon as possible.\n\n- The responsibility for smoke alarm installation and maintenance lies with the homeowner or landlord, however it is a good idea for parents to provide their child with a smoke alarm for his or her bedroom.\n- It is against the law for tenants to disable or tamper with a smoke alarm.\n- If a smoke alarm activates due to steam from the shower or cooking on the stove, oven or toaster, ask the landlord to move the alarm to a different location, or to install a smoke alarm with a pause feature.\n\n#### Fire Escape Planning\n\nWhen the smoke alarm sounds, everyone must know what to do and where to go. Encourage\n\nstudents to develop a fire escape plan, keeping the following in mind:\n\n- Know two ways out of every room, if possible. The first way out would be the door, while the alternate escape could be a window that can be exited safely. Make sure all designated escape routes are accessible and free of clutter.\n- Leave the building as quickly as possible. Once outside, do not re-enter the building for any reason.\n- Call 9-1-1 from outside the building using a cell phone or neighbours phone.\n\n[Off Campus Housing Fire Safety Checklist \u2013 see it before you sign it ![PDF](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-pdf.svg)](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/91a6-Off-Campus-Housing-Fire-Safety-Checklist-see-it-before-you-sign-it.pdf \"PDF Document\")\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=g7brrx25lh0p)",

Homeowners are reminded to take the following precautions:\n\nExpand All Clothes Dryers Fire Safety accordion panelsCollapse All Clothes Dryers Fire Safety accordion panels\n\n## Installation\n\n- Have your dryer installed and serviced by a professional.\n- If you are installing your own dryer, follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions before installing the dryer vent. Determine the straightest and most direct venting path to the outdoors to reduce the likelihood of lint accumulation in bends or elbows.\n- Use rigid or flexible metal ducting for venting to the outdoors. Plastic or metal foil ducts are more prone to kinking, sagging and crushing, which leads to lint build-up. Plastic ducting is also more prone to ignition and melting.\n- Clothes dryers located in closet-type spaces or totally enclosed rooms (e.g. in apartments) should have sufficient incoming air for proper operation (see manufacturer\u2019s instructions).\n\n## What to do?\n\n- Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions regarding the safe use of the dryer.\n- Inspect and clean the lint screen after each load of laundry. The build-up of lint can lead to a fire. Regularly remove lint from metal ducts and exhaust vents. The inside of the dryer cabinet should be cleaned as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n- Regularly inspect the air exhaust to ensure it is not restricted and the outdoor vent flap opens when the dryer is operating.\n- Turn the dryer off if you leave home or when you go to bed.\n- Keep the area around the dryer clear of items that can burn.\n- Install a carbon monoxide alarm in your home if using a natural gas or propane dryer.\n- Ensure there are working smoke alarms on every storey of the home and outside all sleeping areas.\n\n## What Not to do?\n\n- Overload the dryer.\n- Exhaust the dryer indoors.\n- Dry materials or fabrics that have been saturated by chemicals, oils or gasoline (e.g. mops and towels and cloths saturated with wax, flammable solvents or vegetable oils). Even after washing, these substances can start a fire during the drying cycle.\n- Dry natural or synthetic rubber, rubber-coated sneakers, galoshes, foam pillows or any garment with foam padding (e.g. blouses with shoulder pads, bras, bicycle shorts)\n- Dry garments that have been cleaned with dry-cleaning fluid.\n- Use a dryer without a lint filter, or with a lint filter that is loose, damaged or clogged.\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=bqxhhuygpxog)",

When used properly, an extinguisher can save lives and property by putting out a small fire or containing it until firefighters arrive. Fire extinguishers do not replace the need to call Toronto Fire Services. Always call 9-1-1 first when a fire occurs, no matter how small.\n\n**Fire extinguishers are not designed for use on large or spreading fires**. Even on small fires, they are effective only under the following conditions:\n\n- The extinguisher must be rated for the type of fire being extinguished.\n- The extinguisher must be large enough for the fire at hand.\n- The extinguisher must be in good working order, fully charged and within easy reach.\n- The operator must be trained in the proper use of the extinguisher.\n- The operator must be physically capable of lifting, handling and operating the extinguisher.\n\nWhat is Fire?\n\n\nFire is a combination of three elements: heat, fuel and oxygen. Remove any one of these three elements and the fire will go out.\n\nFor example, an ABC multipurpose dry chemical extinguishing agent forms a coating layer over whatever is burning and thereby separates the oxygen from the fuel. The chemical also reduces the heat and interferes with the chemical reaction-combustion process.\n\nIn case of fire or an emergency, call 9-1-1.\n\nWhat Type of Extinguishers are There?\n\n\nThere are five classes of fire extinguishers. Fire extinguishers must be labelled to show the class of fire they can extinguish.\n\n- **Class A**\n\n\nOrdinary combustibles such as paper, wood, rubbish, drapes and upholstery.\n- **Class B**\n\n\nFlammable liquids such as gasoline, oils, solvents, paints and flammable gases.\n- **Class C**\n\n\nElectrical fires involving Class \u201cA\u201d or Class \u201cB\u201d materials and live electrical power \u2013 overheated wiring, fuse boxes, stoves, motors etc.\n- **Class D**\n\n\nCombustible metal fires. Magnesium and Titanium are the most common types of metal fires. Once a metal ignites do not use water in an attempt to extinguish it.\n- **Class K**\n\n\nFires that involve cooking oils, grease or animal fat and can be extinguished using Purple K, the typical agent found in kitchen or galley extinguishers.\n\nThe extinguisher must be tested and listed by The Underwriters\u2019 Laboratories of Canada (ULC). Look for the ULC label on the extinguisher.\n\nWhere Should I Install My Extinguishers?\n\n\nInstall your extinguishers in plain view, above the reach of children, near an exit route, and away from stoves and heating appliances. Ideal locations for your extinguishers are in the kitchen, workshop, upstairs and at the top of a basement stairwell.\n\nWhen Should I Use My Extinguisher to Fight a Fire?\n\n\n**Only fight a fire if**\n\n- the fire is small and not spreading\n- occupants have been alerted\n- everyone has left or is leaving the building\n- 9-1-1 has been called\n- you have a clear escape route that won\u2019t be blocked by fire\n- you know how to operate your extinguisher and are aware of its capabilities\n\nDon\u2019t fight a fire in any other circumstance. Leave the premises immediately, close off the area and call 9-1-1 from a neighbour\u2019s home.\n\nRemember \"P-A-S-S\" when Fighting a Fire\n\n\n(Pull, Aim, Squeeze, Sweep)\n\n- **PULL** out the locking pin, breaking the seal. Some extinguishers may use a different release device. Please refer to your operator\u2019s manual.\n- **AIM** the nozzle horn (or hose) at the base of the fire about 3 metres (10 feet) from the fire.\n- **SQUEEZE** the trigger handle all the way, releasing the extinguishing agent.\n- **SWEEP** the material discharged by the extinguisher from side to side, moving front to back, across the base of the fire until it appears to be out. Keep your eyes on fire area. Repeat the process if the fire starts up again. Never turn your back on a fire even if you think it is out.\n\nMost extinguishers will operate according to the **PASS** method. Some extinguishers may not. Read your operator\u2019s manual for specific directions. Remember to recharge the extinguisher immediately after use.\n\nTake Care of Your Extinguishers\n\n\nExtinguishers require regular care. Learn how to inspect your extinguisher by reading your operator\u2019s manual. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s maintenance instructions. Remember to recharge reusable extinguishers and replace disposable models after every use.\n\nWarning!\n\n\nBe certain that you use the correct type of extinguisher for the fire you are fighting. If you use the wrong type of of extinguisher, you can endanger yourself and even make the fire worse.\n\nNumbers are also used with letters for extinguishers labelled for class A and B fires. The larger the number, the larger the fire the extinguisher can put out. Extinguishers rated ABC Multipurpose provide the required protection for all of the above types of fire.\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=yx93jtk1nwl8)\n\nPCFET0NUWVBFIGh0bWw PGJvZHk 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",

Review these tips to help you prepare for winter.\n\nLearn about [Extreme Cold Weather Alerts](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/health-wellness-care/health-programs-advice/extreme-cold-weather/), how to [shovel snow safely](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/public-safety-alerts/safety-tips-prevention/home-high-rise-school-workplace-safety/snow-shovelling/) and how to [safety get around as a pedestrian, cyclist or driver](https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/streets-parking-transportation/road-maintenance/winter-maintenance/winter-safety-tips/).\n\nExpand All Winter Safety accordion panelsCollapse All Winter Safety accordion panels\n\n## Avoid Frostbite & Hypothermia\n\n### Layer clothing\n\nBuild breathable (cotton, wool) clothing layers to include thermal underwear, undershirt, track suits, sweaters, snowsuits, winter boots, hats, mittens and scarves.\n\n### Cover exposed skin\n\nExposed skin can become frostbitten in as little as 30 seconds, always cover exposed skin especially when the wind is a factor.\n\n### Keep moving\n\nTry to limit the time sitting. Stand up and move around to allow circulation to reach better reach all body parts.\n\n### Blankets and portable seat/cushion\n\nSitting on cold pavement or concrete can increase the risk of hypothermia. Sitting on a blanket or portable seat will limit the risk.\n\n### Drink fluids\n\nDehydration can occur even when the temperature is below freezing. Hot chocolate is a great way to remain well hydrated.\n\n### Avoid alcoholic beverages\n\nAlcohol diminishes the body\u2019s ability to feel the cold and can cause an increased exposure time.\n\n### Signs of hypothermia\n\nConfusion, lethargy, weakness, apathy, pale skin colour.\n\n### Signs of frostbite\n\nPale grey, waxy textured skin in affected area cold to the touch, numbness and localized pain, swelling and blistering.\n\n## Generators\n\nConsumers must know that portable generators can be hazardous if used improperly. The hazards are:\n\n- Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning from the toxic engine exhaust and\n- Electrocution from connecting the generator to the home electrical wiring system.\n\n### To avoid carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning:\n\n- Never use a generator indoors or in attached garages.\n- Only operate the generator outdoors in a well-ventilated, dry area, away from air intakes to the home, and protected from direct exposure to rain and snow, preferably under a canopy, open shed, or carport.\n\n### To avoid electrocution:\n\n- Plug individual appliances into the generator using heavy duty, outdoor rated cords with a wire gauge adequate for the appliance load.\n- Observe the generator manufacturer\u2019s instructions for safe operation.\n- Do not plug the generator into a wall outlet.\n- If connecting the generator into the house wiring is necessary, have a qualified electrician hook up the standby electrical system, or have the local utility install a linking device if available.\n\nNever store gasoline in the home. Gasoline, kerosene and other flammable liquids should be stored outside of living areas in properly labeled, non-glass safety containers. They should also not be stored in a garage if a fuel-burning appliance is in the garage. The vapor from gasoline can travel invisibly along the ground and be ignited by pilot lights or arcs caused by activating electric switches.\n\nIf at all possible, avoid connecting the electrical output of the generator into the house wiring. Instead, connect individual appliances that have their own outdoor rated power cord directly to the receptacle outlet of the generator, or connect these cord-connected appliances to the generator\u2019s electrical outlet via a suitable, outdoor-rated extension cord having a sufficient wire gauge to handle the electrical load.\n\nIf connecting into the house wiring is necessary on a temporary basis to operate permanently wired equipment, such as a water pump, furnace blower/controls, room lighting, etc., there are important steps that require the utmost care to avoid electrocution. In some locations, the local utility company may offer to install a device at the electric meter socket to permit their customers to connect a portable generator to the household wiring during periods of power outages. If that service is not available or chosen, another method is to have a qualified electrician install a manual transfer switch.\n\nA transfer switch permits transfer of the load from the household power source that is normally supplied by the electric utility over to the portable generator. The transfer switch should be certified by UL, CSA, or other independent test lab for this application, and be mounted within an electrical box. Transfer switches and related accessories designed for connecting a standby system are available from electrical supply stores. The equipment for these accessories includes:\n\n- cord sets with special locking and recessed connectors\n- electrical boxes with controls for the branch circuits that will receive temporary power from the generator\n- feeder cable to connect the existing electrical panel to the transfer switch\n\nWhen properly installed, the transfer switch will isolate the circuits supplied by the generator from those normally supplied by the utility. This prevents inadvertently energizing circuits in both systems, and reduces the possibility of electrocution resulting from contact with conductors presumed to be de-energized.\n\nDo not operate more appliances and equipment than the output rating of the generator.\n\n## Space Heaters\n\n- Keep portable and space heaters at least one metre (three feet) away from anything combustible including paper, drapes, loose clothes furniture, bedding and wallpaper.\n- Never place clothes on a heater to dry.\n- Avoid leaving heaters on when you leave the house or go to bed.\n- Keep children well away from heaters.\n\nSpace heaters must have a Canadian Standards Association (CSA) label.\n\n## Fireplaces\n\n- Have a professional inspect and clean your chimney at least once a year.\n- Always use a fire screen.\n- Burn only materials appropriate for a fireplace.\n- Never burn trash or paper \u2013 burning paper can fly out your chimney.\n- Put ashes in metal containers and never store them in your home.\n\n## Be Cautious of Ice when Walking & Driving\n\n- Be nice, clear your ice. This not only helps pedestrians but also the emergency workers that may be responding to your home or work site.\n- Have a safety kit in your car. A first aid kit, booster cables, gloves and hats, non perishable snacks, blanket, and candles would be a great start to protecting yourself while travelling.\n- When driving on snowy or icy roads, keep in mind that it takes longer for vehicles to stop. Reduce your speed on slippery roads and give yourself plenty of room to stop.\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=kpxne2jtjhas)",

Gun violence reduction requires leveraging investments, tools and mandates across sectors and governments, to enhance the efforts of community partners in the areas of violence prevention, intervention, response and recovery. The City of Toronto is working with community partners and other levels of government to steward integration of actions and services across sectors using a trauma informed public health approach.\n\nThrough the implementation of SafeTO, the City\u2019s Community Safety & Well-Being Plan, the City is also expanding its definition of community safety beyond crime or reactive responses by centering the well-being of people and place and committing to a long-term, comprehensive plan and vision to make it a reality.\n\nLeveraging its role as a system leader, service provider and strategic funder, the City of Toronto will transform the City\u2019s gun violence prevention and intervention approaches to ensure system resources are intentional, practical and laser focused on gun violence reduction.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim **June 7, 2024** as **\u201cNational Day Against Gun Violence\u201d** in the City of Toronto.\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=bsqyexl6qumn)",

The Emergency Plan details the methods in which the City mobilizes its resources during a crisis and ensures all City organizations, emergency response services and key agencies are fully aware of their respective roles and responsibilities during an emergency. The goal is to respond and reduce the impact of a public emergency and restore the municipality to a normal state as soon as possible.\n\nExpand All Toronto\u2019s Emergency Plan accordion panelsCollapse All Toronto\u2019s Emergency Plan accordion panels\n\n## 1.0 Introduction\n\nThe City of Toronto is vulnerable to numerous hazards. The hazards can be natural such as extreme weather, human-caused such as an incident at a special event or cyber-attack, or technological such as those involving hazardous materials, infrastructure disruptions, and utility and power failures.\n\nThe City of Toronto Emergency Plan establishes the framework that ensures the City is prepared to deal with any of these hazards. It is the methodology through which the City will mobilize its resources in the event of an emergency, thereby restoring the municipality to a state of normalcy. The Plan is designed to ensure that all agencies which may become involved in an emergency are aware of their respective roles and responsibilities during that emergency and participate in the emergency management program.\n\nAdditionally, the Emergency Plan makes provisions for the earliest possible coordinated response to an emergency, an understanding of the personnel and resources available to the City, and recognition that additional expertise and resources can be called upon if required.\n\nThe Emergency Plan is utilized as a tool to assist emergency and municipal services and officials in their emergency response activities to provide an efficient and effective response to an emergency. The Plan must be flexible enough to adapt to a broad spectrum of emergencies and must be supported with:\n\n- adequate personnel, equipment and expertise from the response agencies\n- familiarity with contents of the Plan and its supporting documents by participating agencies\n- training and exercises\n- awareness of resources available from neighbouring municipalities and the private sector, supplemented by prearranged agreements\n- testing of the Plan on a regular basis\n- review of the Plan following an emergency or exercise where it was implemented\n\nThe Emergency Plan outlines how City agencies will respond to, recover from, and mitigate the impact of an emergency. The Plan contains sections that describe legal authorities, planning assumptions, concept of operations, operational life cycle, organizational responsibilities, and the preparedness cycle.\n\nEmergency Support Functions are supporting documents to the Emergency Plan that provide structure for City divisions, agencies and corporations and outside stakeholders that work collaboratively to provide coordinated support, resources and personnel during an emergency response to an incident. The documents describe how the City\u2019s divisions, agencies and corporations and outside stakeholders coordinate to save lives, protect property and the environment, restore essential services and critical infrastructure, and help victims and communities return to normal following an emergency.\n\nRisk-Specific Plans are also supporting documents to the Emergency Plan. They contain specific response plans for hazards that may pose a threat to the City of Toronto. These plans reflect the City of Toronto\u2019s Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (see [Section 7.0](#_7.0_Hazard_Identification)).\n\n## 2.0 Purpose\n\nThe aim of the City of Toronto Emergency Plan is to provide the framework for extraordinary arrangements and measures that can be taken to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the inhabitants of the City of Toronto when faced with an emergency.\n\nThe Plan unifies the efforts of the City\u2019s divisions, agencies and corporations and outside stakeholders for a comprehensive and effective approach to response and reduction of impact from an emergency. It is intended to increase the emergency response capability of the City of Toronto by establishing a plan of action to efficiently and effectively deploy emergency services.\n\n## 3.0 Scope\n\nThis Emergency Plan and its supporting documents (Emergency Support Functions and Risk-Specific Plans) outline the coordinated response that the City of Toronto undertakes in collaboration with its divisions, agencies and corporations and outside stakeholders to ensure an effective response and recovery from an emergency.\n\n## 4.0 Legal Authorities\n\nLegislation under which the municipality, its employees and agents are authorized to respond to an emergency are as follows:\n\n- [City of Toronto Municipal Code, Chapter 59, Emergency Management (\u201cChapter 59\u201d) ![PDF](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-pdf.svg)](https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/municode/1184_059.pdf \"PDF Document\")\n- [Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90e09)\n\n### 4.1 Toronto Municipal Code, Chapter 59, Emergency Management\n\nThe provisions of Chapter 59 provide the governance structure, including delegated authorities, membership of the Toronto Emergency Management Program Committee and reporting relationships to City Council.\n\n### 4.2 Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act\n\nThe [Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90e09) is provincial legislation which, among other subjects, imposes requirements on municipalities concerning their emergency management program. Section 2.1 of the Act requires municipalities to develop and implement an emergency management program and adopt it through by-law. An emergency management program must consist of:\n\n- an emergency plan\n- training programs and exercises for employees of municipalities and other persons with respect to the provision of required services and procedures to be followed in emergency response and recovery activities,\n- public education on risks to public safety and on public preparedness for emergencies, and\n- any other element required by standards for emergency management programs that may be developed by the Minister of Community Safety and Correctional Services\n\nIn developing the emergency management program, the municipality must identify and assess various hazards and risks to public safety that could give rise to emergencies and identify the facilities and other elements of the infrastructure that are at risk of being affected by emergencies. Each municipality must conduct training programs and exercises to ensure the readiness of employees of the municipality and other persons to act under the emergency plan. Each municipality shall review and, if necessary, revise its emergency plan on an annual basis.\n\nThe Minister of Community Safety and Correctional Services can establish standards for development and implementation of emergency management programs and for the formulation and implementation of emergency plans.\n\n## 5.0 Planning Assumptions\n\n- An emergency is defined under the [Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90e09) as a situation or an impending situation that constitutes a danger of major proportions that could result in serious harm to persons or substantial damage to property and that is caused by the forces of nature, a disease or other health risk, an accident or an act whether intentional or otherwise.\n- During regular operations, Incidents (Level 1) are within the response capabilities of the City and its Divisions, Agencies, and Corporations. A Level 2 or 3 (Emergency or Major Emergency) will likely strain the City\u2019s capabilities and require provincial and/or federal assistance (see [Section 9.2](#_9.2_Emergency_Levels)).\n- An emergency in the City may occur with little or no warning, and may escalate more rapidly than response organizations can manage.\n- An emergency may cause injury, fatalities, property loss, and disruption of normal support systems. A large number of casualties, heavy damage to buildings and basic infrastructure, and disruption of essential public services may stress the capabilities of the City to meet the needs of the situation.\n- Achieving and maintaining effective resident and community preparedness reduces the immediate demands on response organizations. Public awareness and education programs are required to ensure residents will take appropriate advance actions to reduce their vulnerability especially during the first 72 hours of an emergency.\n- When the City\u2019s resources are strained, additional resources may be requested through mutual assistance agreements with neighbouring municipalities and/or through requests to the provincial and federal governments.\n- The Emergency Operations Centre will be activated and staffed to manage the strategic response to the emergency and to support emergency operations at the site.\n- Members of the Toronto Emergency Management Program Committee will be required to mobilize on short notice to provide timely and effective direction or assistance.\n- If activated, members of the Emergency Management Working Group (the \u201cWorking Group\u201d) or a designate from their Division, Agency or Corporation will be required to respond on short notice to attend the Emergency Operations Centre.\n- Each Division, Agency and Corporation will track, document and seek reimbursement, as appropriate, for costs incurred during emergency response and recovery operations.\n\n## 6.0 Emergency Management Governance Structure\n\n### 6.1 Toronto Emergency Management Program Committee\n\nChapter 59 defines the composition of the Toronto Emergency Management Program Committee.\n\n### Composition\n\nThe Toronto Emergency Management Program Committee shall consist of representatives holding positions in the City, its divisions, agencies and corporations, or those designated to act on their behalf.\n\nThe membership of the Toronto Emergency Management Program Committee includes the following positions or such successor titles as outlined in Chapter 59:\n\n- Mayor\n- Deputy Mayor\n- City Manager\n- Deputy City Manager, Community & Social Services\n- Deputy City Manager, Corporate Services\n- Deputy City Manager, Infrastructure & Development Services\n- Fire Chief and General Manager, Toronto Fire Services\n- Chief and General Manager, Toronto Paramedic Services\n- Medical Officer of Health\n- Director, Strategic Communications\n- Chief People Officer\n- General Manager, Transportation Services\n- General Manager, Toronto Water\n- General Manager, Shelter, Support and Housing Administration\n- City Solicitor\n- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\n- Chief Building Official and Executive Director, Toronto Building\n- General Manager, Parks, Forestry and Recreation\n- General Manager, Solid Waste Management\n- General Manager, Facilities Management\n- Chief Technology Officer\n- Director, Insurance and Risk Management\n- Director, Toronto Emergency Management\n- City Clerk\n- Chief Resilience Officer (or the appropriate successor position that has assumed this role\u2019s functions)\n- Chief Information Security Officer\n- Executive Director, Engineering & Construction Services\n- Chief of Police\n- Chief General Manager, Toronto Transit Commission\n- Chief Executive Officer and Secretary Treasurer, Toronto and Region Conservation Authority\n- Executive Vice-President, Toronto Hydro\n\n### Objectives of the Toronto Emergency Management Program Committee\n\nThe City of Toronto Emergency Management Program Committee provides the City with an effective vehicle for developing and maintaining a comprehensive emergency management program, as defined under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act and Chapter 59.\n\n### Toronto Emergency Management Program Committee Control Group\n\nIn the event of an emergency, the Toronto Emergency Management Program Committee Control Group (the \u201cControl Group\u201d) convenes as it becomes reactive. The membership of the Control Group remains the same as the Toronto Emergency Management Program Committee.\n\nThe Mayor; or in the absence or unavailability of the Mayor, the City Manager; or, alternatively a designate for the Mayor, or City Manager as may be required, will act as Chair of the Control Group as specified in Chapter 59. The Control Group will provide overall policy and strategic direction to the Emergency Operations Centre to support the evolving response activities on the road to recovery.\n\nThe Emergency Operations Centre will coordinate the City\u2019s response to the emergency using the Incident Management System. The foundation of the Incident Management System is the collaboration and coordination in the establishment of goals, the setting of priorities and the assignment of resources to effectively manage the emergency.\n\n### Authority of Control Group\n\nUnder section 59-7.1, of Chapter 59 in the event of an emergency, whether declared or not under the Act, the Control Group is authorized to:\n\n- initiate, coordinate, direct and otherwise bring about the implementation of the Plan and undertake such other activities as they consider necessary to address the emergency\n- expend funds for the purposes of responding to and recovering from the emergency, including obtaining and distributing emergency materials, equipment and supplies, notwithstanding the requirements of any by-law governing the commitment of funds and the payment of accounts\n- obtain volunteer support from public agencies and other persons as considered necessary and to indemnify such agencies, their personnel, and other persons engaged in work that has been authorized pursuant to this Chapter or any other law, from liability for any acts or omissions resulting from any actions taken pursuant to this Chapter or any other law\n\n### Role of Chair, Control Group\n\nThe Chair of the Control Group is responsible for initiating, coordinating and directing activities that the Control Group considers necessary to respond to the emergency including, but not limited to:\n\n- taking actions considered necessary to implement the Emergency Plan and to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public and protect property, government infrastructure, and the environment; these actions are not contrary to law or the responsibilities and authorities of the Chief of Police, Fire Chief and General Manager, Medical Officer of Health and/or Chief Building Official and Executive Director of Toronto Building\n- ensuring that a designated City spokesperson is appointed to provide a coordinated approach in directing public information activities during the initial phase of the emergency\n- coordinating communications between the Mayor\u2019s Office and/or Council and the Control Group on the necessary actions being taken\n- determining if municipal resources are adequate or if further resources are required\n- providing advice on an emergency declaration and terminating an emergency\n- ensuring that when required, assistance be facilitated from other levels of government\n- liaising with other levels of government on areas of collaboration and cooperation\n\n### 6.2 Notifying City Manager of Emergency\n\nThe Deputy City Manager, Infrastructure and Development Services, or designate contacts the City Manager to report that the City of Toronto Emergency Operations Centre has been activated. Depending on the nature of the emergency, the Director, Toronto Emergency Management, or any member of the Toronto Emergency Management Program Committee may notify the City Manager of an impending or actual emergency and request activation of the Emergency Operations Centre.\n\n### 6.3 Emergency Management Working Group\n\n### Composition\n\nChapter 59 defines the composition of the Emergency Management Working Group (\u201cWorking Group\u201d), as those persons selected by the Toronto Emergency Management Program Committee. Under this authority, the Toronto Emergency Management Program Committee has selected that the Working Group will consist of the following positions:\n\n| **Division/ Agency/ Corporation** | **Working Group Member Job Title** |\n| --- | --- |\n| 311 Toronto | Operations Manager |\n| City Clerk\u2019s Office | Manager, Business Transformation and Strategic Support |\n| City Manager\u2019s Office | Director, Executive Administration |\n| Corporate Real Estate Management | Manager, Corporate Security |\n| Deputy City Manager\u2019s Office, Community and Social Services | Executive Assistant |\n| Deputy City Manager\u2019s Office, Corporate Services | Manager, Program and Strategic Support |\n| Deputy City Manager\u2019s Office, Infrastructure and Development Services | Manager, Policy & Strategic Issues |\n| Engineering & Construction Services | Manager, Business Improvement & Standards, Engineering Support Services |\n| Toronto Emergency Management (Chair) | Director |\n| Office of the Chief Financial Officer | Management Consultant |\n| Parks, Forestry and Recreation | Manager, Stakeholder Relations & Issues Management |\n| People and Equity | Manager, Business Management Services |\n| Purchasing and Materials Management | Manager, Main Office & Warehouse |\n| Shelter, Support and Housing Administration | Project Director, Homelessness Initiative |\n| Solid Waste Management Services | Program Manager, Strategic Initiatives |\n| Strategic Partnerships | Director |\n| Strategic Public and Employee Communications | Manager, Media Relations & Issues Management |\n| Technology Services | Manager, Management Services |\n| Toronto and Region Conservation Authority | Associate Director of Engineering Services |\n| Toronto Building | District Manager, Inspections, Toronto & East York District |\n| Toronto Fire Services | Division Commander, Technical Operations |\n| Toronto Hydro | Supervisor, Grid Emergency Management |\n| Toronto Paramedic Services | Commander, Community Safeguard Services |\n| Toronto Police Service | Sergeant |\n| Toronto Public Health | Manager, Planning, Performance & Standards |\n| Toronto Public Library | Manager, Service Development \u2013 Venue & Community Space Rentals |\n| Toronto Transit Commission | Director of Emergency Management and Fire Safety |\n| Toronto Water | Director, Environment, Energy and Emergency Planning |\n| Transportation Services | Manager, Business Support |\n\n### 6.4 Authority to Activate the Emergency Operations Centre\n\nAny member of the Toronto Emergency Management Program Committee or Working Group has the authority and responsibility to request an activation of the Emergency Operations Centre and initiate the implementation of the Emergency Plan. Requests to activate the Emergency Operations Centre are directed to either the Director of Toronto Emergency Management or to Toronto Emergency Management\u2019s 24 hours a day, 7 days a week Standby Function.\n\nShould an incident be classified as a Level 2 Emergency or Level 3 Major Emergency, the Toronto Emergency Management Standby Function is contacted by Toronto Fire Services, Toronto Police Service and/or Toronto Paramedic Services. Toronto Emergency Management staff would connect with the Deputy City Manager, Infrastructure and Development Services, to initiate the implementation of the Emergency Plan.\n\nThe City of Toronto uses a three tier emergency level system to determine appropriate notifications as follows:\n\n- Level 1 \u2013 Incident\n- Level 2 \u2013 Emergency\n- Level 3 \u2013 Major Emergency\n\nUpon receiving an emergency notification,Toronto Emergency Management 24/7 Standby Function will liaise with the notifying division, agencies or corporation and utilize the Emergency Level Notifications table (see [Section 9.2](#_9.2_Emergency_Levels)) as a tool to assist in establishing the immediate notifications that may be necessary and/or appropriate.\n\n### 6.5 Staffing the Emergency Operations Centre\n\nThe Emergency Operations Centre ensures that the Control Group can uphold core functions of the Emergency Plan, including:\n\n- effective policy and strategic direction to the emergency\n- support of emergency operations at the site(s)\n- consequence management\n- resource management to support the site(s)\n- coordination of management links to other Command/Divisional Operations Centres, external agencies and the Provincial Emergency Operations Centre\n- provide information to the public and the news media\n- maintain business continuity for the rest of the City\n\nDuring a response, select members of the Working Group will establish and convene at the Emergency Operations Centre to activate these functions. The Emergency Operations Centre staff will provide operational guidance and support to the Incident Commander who maintains the lead role at a site. When divisions establish Divisional Operations Centres to provide operational support during an emergency response, there is a need to centralize efforts and coordinate operational response between all responding divisions. This function is provided by the City\u2019s Emergency Operations Centre.\n\nThe City\u2019s Emergency Operations Centre staffing plan ensures that the Emergency Operations Centre is always operationally ready for activation. Staff are required to take pre-requisite training to enable an effective and efficient implementation of Emergency Operations Centre initiatives through the Incident Management System.\n\n6.6 Role of Emergency Operations Centre Director\n\nThe Emergency Operations Centre Director has overall authority and responsibility for activities of the Emergency Operations Centre and for ensuring organizational effectiveness. The Emergency Operations Centre Director establishes the Emergency Operations Centre\u2019s staffing levels, sets the Emergency Operations Centre priorities and objectives for each operational period and ensures objectives are carried out. The Emergency Operations Centre Director briefs the Control Group and other senior officials, as required, and directs appropriate public information in coordination with the Chief Communications Officer.\n\n### 6.7 Site Response and Emergency Operations Centre Support\n\nThe Emergency Operations Centre maintains a dedicated facility from which the City of Toronto coordinates its strategic response to an emergency. The Emergency Operations Centre coordinates the management of resources, personnel and incident information.\n\nThe Emergency Operations Centre does not replace the need for a sound command structure at the site; instead, it complements the site with further coordination, resource management, information management and overall support.\n\n6.8 Toronto Police Service Major Incident Command Centre\n\nThe Toronto Police Service Major Incident Command Centre is a central point of command, control, communication and information for the Toronto Police Service. When activated, the Major Incident Command Centre\u2019s Incident Commander has a full perspective of all resources under the command of the Toronto Police Service and tactical oversight of those resources in their function of ensuring public safety and security.\n\nWhen activated, the Major Incident Command Centre is responsible for the continuity of policing services throughout the City of Toronto and for liaising with the City\u2019s Emergency Operations Centre (if activated) which provides links to all City divisions, agencies and corporations.\n\nDuring a Major Incident Command Centre activation, the City\u2019s Toronto Emergency Management may send a representative to convene at the Major Incident Command Centre and act as a Liaison Officer.\n\nToronto Fire Services, Toronto Paramedic Services, Toronto Transit Commission and other external partners may also attend the Major Incident Command Centre to oversee coordination of their respective services with Toronto Police Service operations.\n\n6.9 Councillor Roles in an Emergency\n\nThe Toronto Emergency Management Program Committee approved the Councillor Coordination Emergency Support Function in 2015. This Emergency Support Function outlines when and how Councillors\u2019 Offices are notified of an activation of the Emergency Operations Centre. It outlines protocols for regular communication with Councillors during a Level 2 Emergency or a Level 3 Major Emergency. The Emergency Support Function also outlines the councillors\u2019 requirements for keeping contact information for themselves and their staff up to date and responding to the quarterly requirement to confirm their information for the mass notification system. It specifies parameters for training of appropriate parties, including councillors and their staff, City Clerk\u2019s Office and Toronto Emergency Management.\n\nThe Councillor Coordination Emergency Support Function also outlines the role of the councillors\u2019 offices throughout an emergency. For example, during a Level 2 Emergency or Level 3 Major Emergency, councillors leverage formal and informal community networks to help disseminate the information provided by the Emergency Operations Centre Councillor Coordination Liaison. They also report urgent matters to the Councillor Coordination Liaison for escalation to the appropriate parties.\n\n6.10 Standardized Response Goals\n\nA response goal is a broad statement that describes a desired outcome. Priorities for response goals generally focus on eliminating or minimizing impacts of the incident on people, property and financial resources.\n\nEmergency Operations Centre staff ensure that all levels of the response management system adhere to standardized response goals in the following order of priority:\n\n- provide for the safety and health of responders\n- save lives\n- reduce suffering\n- protect public health\n- protect government infrastructure\n- protect property\n- protect the environment\n- reduce economic and social losses\n\n6.11 External Organizations \u2013 Private Sector Partners\n\nDepending on the nature of the emergency, external organizations may be asked to provide a representative (e.g., Enbridge, Greater Toronto Airport Authority, Canadian National or Canadian Pacific Rail, etc.) to join the Emergency Operations Centre to assist in coordinating the response.\n\n### 6.12 Divisional Emergency Management\n\nTo fully implement the emergency management program horizontally and vertically throughout the City of Toronto\u2019s organizational structure, it is recommended that those divisions with membership on Toronto Emergency Management Program Committee and/or Working Group have a designated staff member(s), with roles and responsibilities included in formal job descriptions. This increases the City of Toronto\u2019s ability to mitigate, prepare, respond and recover from emergencies and major emergencies and begin the process of embedding an emergency management and business continuity culture to routine business processes and program considerations.\n\n## 7.0 Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA)\n\nHazard Identification and Risk Assessment is an evaluation method used to understand hazards. This method helps determine which hazards are most likely to result in an emergency and allows for the comparison of risk between hazards.\n\nToronto Emergency Management has identified and assessed the various hazards and risks to public safety that could give rise to emergencies and has identified the facilities and other elements of the infrastructure that are at risk of being affected by emergencies. Toronto Emergency Management has developed Emergency Support Functions and Risk-Specific Plans based on this assessment.\n\nThere are three major categories of hazards that may pose a threat to the City of Toronto:\n\n- natural hazards are hazards that are caused by forces of nature; human activity may trigger or worsen the hazard\n- human-caused hazards are hazards that result from direct human action or inaction, either intentional or unintentional\n- technological hazards are hazards that arise from the manufacture, transportation, and use of substances such as radioactive materials, chemicals, explosives, and flammables\n\nThe top 10 risks for the City of Toronto are:\n\n01. energy emergency (supply)\n02. explosions / fires\n03. winter weather\n04. pandemic\n05. cyber threats\n06. terrorism\n07. epidemic\n08. flood\n09. fuel/ natural gas supply disruption\n10. extreme heat\n\n## 8.0 Preparedness Cycle\n\nThe Emergency Plan will be maintained, reviewed, and updated according to a preparedness cycle that includes four phases: plan, operate, evaluate, and take corrective action. Participation of the Toronto Emergency Management Program Committee during all phases of this cycle ensures that the Plan reflects the current policies, organizational structures, and methodologies utilized by the City of Toronto.\n\nDiagram Description: This diagram depicts the maintenance schedule of the Emergency Plan\n\n![](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/96c1-Preparedness-Cycle-500x253.png)\n\nPreparedness Cycle\n\n## 9.0 Concept of Operations\n\n### 9.1 General\n\nThe City\u2019s emergency services (Toronto Police Service, Toronto Fire Services, and Toronto Paramedic Services) and other divisions, agencies and corporations manage many incidents that occur on a day-to-day basis. As the magnitude of an emergency increases, so will the requirement for additional support from within the City. The City\u2019s Emergency Operations Centre may be activated to provide support. The Control Group may elect to call upon neighbouring municipalities to provide mutual assistance in accordance with standing agreements. The City may also call upon the provincial government to provide supplemental financial and/or physical resources necessary to deal with the overall impacts of the emergency.\n\nThe City\u2019s Emergency Plan adopts the principles of the Incident Management System. The Incident Management System is a standardized approach to emergency management that encompasses personnel, facilities, equipment, procedures and communications operating within a common organizational structure. Incident Management System concepts and principles include comprehensive resource management, action planning, integrated communications, interoperability, a modular and scalable framework, standard terminology, and span of control.\n\nThe five major sections of the Incident Management System (Command, Operations, Planning, Logistics and Finance & Administration) can be expanded or contracted to meet requirements as an event progresses.\n\nThe response to an emergency in the City will be managed using the Toronto Emergency Plan and any relevant Emergency Support Functions and Risk-Specific Plans with the following assumptions:\n\n- the Head of each division, agency and corporation is responsible for the overall operation of their organization\n- use of mutual aid assistance for cooperative response will be entered into and maintained with adjoining municipalities for the purpose of reciprocal assistance\n- normal communication modes and reporting channels will be used to the maximum practical extent; back-up communications systems will be used in the event that commercial communications systems are disrupted, saturated, or otherwise unavailable\n- City divisions will employ their standard business continuity and business resumption planning principles to ensure the continuity of essential services\n- day-to-day functions that do not contribute directly to the operation may be suspended for the duration of the emergency; efforts that would normally be required of those day-to-day functions will be redirected to accomplish the emergency task\n\n9.2 Emergency Levels\n\nMost emergencies are managed at site by emergency services and other divisions, agencies and corporations are considered routine operations. Emergencies of greater magnitude do happen from time to time and require an emergency management response structure beyond normal daily operations. The required response must be appropriate to the magnitude of the incident and follow the four level notification system as defined in the following Emergency Level Notifications table.\n\n**Table 1: Emergency Level Notifications**\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Level 1 \u2013 Incident** |\n| Operational Implications | This level requires coordination, collaboration and/or communications for one or a combination of the following:<br>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 effective policy and strategic direction to the emergency<br>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 support of emergency operations at the site(s)<br>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 consequence management<br>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 resource management<br>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 coordination of management linkages to the site, Divisional Operations Centre(s), external agencies and the Provincial Emergency Operations Centre<br>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 information to the public and news media<br>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 business continuity for the rest of the City |\n| Toronto Emergency Management Support | Support available through 24/7 Standby Function. |\n| City Division Notification | Lead division(s) will follow established notification and escalation procedures to their chain of command. |\n| Toronto Emergency Management Notification | No notifications required as division(s) will follow established internal notification and escalation procedures.<br>Toronto Emergency Management is activated to monitor, it will notify members of the Control Group, Emergency Management Working Group, Strategic Public and Employee Communications, City Clerk\u2019s Office and other divisions, agencies and corporations. |\n| Examples | Localized power disruptions, severe weather watches and warnings, localized flooding, Emergency Social Services coordination and response. |\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Level 2 \u2013 Emergency** |\n| Operational Implications | This level requires coordination, collaboration and/or communications for one or a combination of the following:<br>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 effective policy and strategic direction to the emergency<br>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 support of emergency operations at the site(s)<br>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 consequence management<br>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 resource management<br>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 coordination of management linkages to the site, Divisional Operations Centre, external agencies and the Provincial Emergency Operations Centre<br>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 information to the public and news media<br>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 business continuity for the rest of the City |\n| Toronto Emergency Management Support | Toronto Emergency Management will:<br>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 facilitate access to City divisions/external agencies and/or<br>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 facilitate integration of City divisions/external agencies into the Incident Management System in the Emergency Operations Centre and/or<br>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 attend site as a Liaison Officer |\n| City Division Notification | Lead divisions will follow established notification and escalation procedures to their chain of command and Toronto Emergency Management. |\n| Toronto Emergency Management Notification | Toronto Emergency Management will notify:<br>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Deputy City Manager, Infrastructure and Development Services<br>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 City Clerk\u2019s Office<br>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Strategic Public and Employee Communications<br>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Control Group, Emergency Management Working Group and Emergency Social Services Working Group<br>Strategic Public and Employee Communications will activate the Emergency Information and Media Relations Emergency Support Function<br>The City Clerk\u2019s Office will notify Councillors of the activation of the Emergency Operations Centre and the activation of the Councillor Coordination Emergency Support Function.

It outlines protocols for regular communication with Councillors during a Level 2 Emergency or a Level 3 Major Emergency. It specifies parameters for training for appropriate parties, including Councillors and their staff, City Clerk\u2019s Office staff and Toronto Emergency Management staff.\n\n### Animal Care and Relief Services\n\nAnimal care and relief is coordinated by Toronto Animal Services in the Municipal Licensing & Standards Division and delivered by pre-identified animal care and relief responders with pre-determined roles that come together to provide these services in emergencies. The Animal Care and Relief Services Emergency Support Function outlines the response provided to service and companion animals that are displaced or otherwise affected by an emergency and provides an overview of roles and responsibilities.\n\n### Damage Assessment\n\nThe purpose of the Damage Assessment Emergency Support Function is to define the roles and responsibilities of City of Toronto divisions, agencies and corporations in order to provide guidance to staff related to the inspection and reporting on the condition of buildings, designated structures and municipal infrastructure.\n\n### Debris Management\n\nThe Debris Management Emergency Support Function defines the roles and responsibilities of divisions, agencies and corporations for the management (removal and disposition) of debris following an incident. The purpose of this Emergency Support Function is to mitigate against any potential threat to lives, health, safety and welfare of the impacted citizens, expedite search and rescue and/or recovery efforts of impacted area(s).\n\n### Emergency Donations Management\n\nThis Emergency Donations Management Emergency Support Function applies to financial contributions and donated goods. It guides emergency donations management during an emergency response. It does not include offers of personal service or labour.\n\n### Emergency Information and Media Relations\n\nThe Emergency Information and Media Relations Emergency Support Function outlines the role of the Strategic Public and Employee Communications Division during an emergency and supports the City of Toronto\u2019s efforts to assist Toronto residents in coping with, and recovering from, a Level 2 Emergency or Level 3 Major Emergency.\n\nThe Strategic Public and Employee Communications Division is responsible for implementation and oversight of the City of Toronto\u2019s communications activities. The Division will provide advice to the City\u2019s divisions, agencies and corporations as required, or as directed by the City Manager.\n\nStrategic Public and Employee Communications is responsible for communicating critical information before an impending incident (if applicable), during and after a major disaster or public emergency on behalf of the Emergency Operations Centre and City officials to 311 Toronto, City staff, members of Council, community leaders, residents, businesses and the media.\n\nThis Emergency Support Function addresses the principles, planning assumptions and concept of operations for emergency information, issues management and media relations for a potential or imminent emergency.\n\nIf the emergency involves multiple jurisdictions, communications may be joint where necessary or appropriate. In the event of a major public emergency that requires a provincial and/or federal response, Strategic Public and Employee Communications will coordinate City of Toronto communications with provincial and federal officials as appropriate.\n\n### Emergency Social Services\n\nThe Emergency Social Services Emergency Support Function outlines the response provided when residents are displaced or otherwise affected by an emergency. This Emergency Support Function guides the Emergency Social Services response provided during a Level 1 \u2013 Incident up to a Level 3 \u2013 Major Emergency.\n\nThis Emergency Support Function does not include services for people who require immediate medical care. When evacuees who need immediate medical assistance are identified, services are provided by Toronto Paramedic Services through 911 calls and other procedures. Long-term housing is also outside the scope of this Emergency Support Function.\n\n### Evacuation\n\nThis Emergency Support Function deals with planning and preparing for a decision to evacuate an area in the event of an emergency or pending emergency, a description of responsibilities to conduct the evacuation, and the process for re-entry. It includes a description of the responsibilities of staff, agencies and procedures involved in alerting the community of the need to evacuate, movement of the population during the evacuation and re-entry of the population once the affected area is deemed safe.\n\nSince emergencies and pending emergencies are diverse in nature, it is difficult to create a plan that has a detailed account of the duties involved. The aim of this document is to provide guidance for the responsibilities that will ensure the safety and security of the community during an emergency evacuation.\n\n### Mass Casualty\n\nThe Mass Casualty Emergency Support Function describes a coordinated and effective approach to providing health and medical assistance in the immediate aftermath of a mass casualty emergency that impedes routine health and medical services within the City of Toronto. It provides direction for responding to mass casualty needs following an emergency. Assistance provided under this Emergency Support Function is directed by Toronto Paramedic Services and is supported by several agencies within the City as well as the coordination between the agencies and private healthcare service providers.\n\n### Traffic Management\n\nThe Traffic Management Emergency Support Function describes the transportation resources (facilities, equipment, materials, supplies, and human and technical information) that support the City\u2019s ability to implement an emergency transportation response. The aim of this Emergency Support Function is to provide the inter-Divisional and inter-agency operational support responsibilities that will ensure the safety and security of first responders, the general public and visitors to the City of Toronto.\n\n### Volunteer Management\n\nThe purpose of this Emergency Support Function is to facilitate and coordinate the placement of unaffiliated volunteers to assist in an emergency. It defines the roles and responsibilities within the volunteer coordination plan and provides guidance to Human Resources as the lead division for volunteer coordination.\n\n### 9.4 Risk Specific Plans\n\n### Flooding\n\nThe purpose of the Flooding Risk-Specific Plan is to provide a framework for the coordination of the City of Toronto\u2019s response to ensure public safety and to minimize damage to property in the event of a major flood event. This document identifies the major response and recovery activities undertaken by the City of Toronto and its outside stakeholders during a flood event, with details of specific activities each partner agency may undertake during a flood event.\n\n### Nuclear Emergency Response Plan\n\nThe City of Toronto Nuclear Emergency Response Plan describes how the city will coordinate its efforts in response to an emergency at the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station.\n\n### Power Disruption (Electricity)\n\nThe purpose of the Power Disruption Risk-Specific Plan is to identify the general roles and responsibilities that City of Toronto divisions, agencies and corporations have in responding to a power failure event and, if necessary, to assist Toronto Hydro\u2019s efforts to coordinate a timely and effective response to a power failure event. In addition, this Risk-Specific Plan identifies operational procedures among the participating City divisions, agencies and corporations with respect to their individual role(s) during a power interruption event. These procedures are intended to ensure the health and safety of responding personnel, and to contribute to a coordinated recovery plan.\n\n## 10.0 Recovery Operations\n\nRecovery planning identifies issues, coordinates resources, ensures information is accurate and reliable, and works to restore utilities and other services in a timely manner. It provides an accountable, transparent process that ensures recovery services are accessible and applied in a consistent manner City-wide.\n\nRecovery is a coordinated process of supporting affected communities in the reconstruction of the physical infrastructure and restoration of emotional, social, economic and physical wellbeing.\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=evozxdkyraaw)",

In Canada, the [Environment & Climate Change Canada website ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://weather.gc.ca/forecast/canada/index_e.html?id=ON) has the latest information.\n\n- Even if there is no rain, if you can hear thunder, you are within striking distance of lightning. Seek shelter immediately.\n- Good places to take shelter include an automobile (with a metal roof), or a grounded building such as a house. Stay sheltered for 30 minutes after the last flash of lightning.\n- While indoors, refrain from using, and preferably unplug electronic equipment such as televisions and computers, as well as appliances, (corded) power tools, or (corded) telephones. Refrain from bathing, showering or washing dishes.\n- If caught outdoors during a thunderstorm, stay away from tall objects such as trees, or any objects or structures that conduct electricity, including metal fences, golf clubs, lawnmowers, bicycles, or umbrellas. Avoid bodies of water.\n- Avoid being the high point in an open area. Low-lying areas are preferable to hillsides.\n- If lightning strikes nearby (for example if 30 or fewer seconds elapse between the flash of lightning and the thunderclap) when you are outdoors with no suitable place to take shelter, crouch down, putting your feet together with the heels touching, and your hands over your ears to protect against hearing damage.\n\nIf someone has been struck by lightning, call 9\u20111\u20111 immediately. People who have been struck by lightning may be in shock, and/or suffering from burns. If breathing has stopped, perform CPR until paramedics arrive. People who have been struck by lightning do not carry an electrical charge and can be safely handled right away.\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=lrocbl95jxgx)",

The session will also provide an opportunity to reflect on the impact of community loss on individual and collective wellbeing,\u00a0 and explore tools for coping and supporting ourselves and each other.\n\nAnnual Reports\n\n\nTo review reports on the Community Healing Project please see below:\n\n[CHP in 2020: Year 1 in Review ![PDF](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-pdf.svg)](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/9532-CHP-2020-Year-1-Review-AODA.pdf \"PDF Document\")\n\n[CHP in 2021: Year 2 in Review ![PDF](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-pdf.svg)](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/8d9b-CHP-2021-Year-2-Review-AODA.pdf \"PDF Document\")\n\n[CHP in 2022: Year 3 in Review ![PDF](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-pdf.svg)](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/95bb-CHP-2022-Year-3-Review-AODA.pdf \"PDF Document\")\n\n[CHP in 2023: Final Evaluation ![PDF](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-pdf.svg)](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/8e37-CHP-in-2023-Final-Evaluation.pdf \"PDF Document\")\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=nyfnrif4jx1r)\n\nPCFET0NUWVBFIGh0bWw PGJvZHk 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",

These buildings commonly have at least three (3) apartments, with some apartments sharing a common exit or are located above another apartment and sharing a common exit.\n\n[The Ontario Fire Code section 9.5 ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/070213) also applies to buildings containing one or two dwelling units in combination with rooming/lodging/boarding accommodations for up to four (4) people (combination arrangement).\n\nThe Ontario Fire Code section 9.5 also applies to other unique residential arrangements, but not addressed here.\n\nConditions and factors that increase risk of fire and injury in this type of housing:\n\n- Renovation typically done without required City review and approval (no building permit).\n- Inadequate exits for Basement, 2nd, and 3rd Floors. At least two (2) exits are required for these floor levels, and they are typically not provided. Note: open stairs, or enclosed stairs without a door discharging directly outdoors are not exits.\n- Lack of interconnected smoke alarm or fire alarm system throughout building (due to no building permit).\n- Interior finishes not Code compliant, increasing speed of flame spread.\n- Lack of proper electrical upgrades to accommodate increased electrical loads, and/or electrical upgrades not ESA (Electrical Safety Authority) inspected and approved (typically for combination arrangements).\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=9mj1dpdhfmdq)\n\nPCFET0NUWVBFIGh0bWw PGJvZHk 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",

Exposure to small amounts of toxic substances can have long term effects on the developing brain, lungs and reproductive system of an unborn baby or young child.\n\nExpand All Environmental Hazards accordion panelsCollapse All Environmental Hazards accordion panels\n\n## Dust\n\n- Household dust contains small amounts of toxic substances such as chemicals, [mould](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/health-wellness-care/health-programs-advice/mould/) and pet dander.\n- These substances can be harmful to children\u2019s health.\n- Children can be exposed to dust through:\n  - swallowing by touching dusty surfaces and transferring to their mouth especially when playing or crawling on the floor\n  - breathing in dust\n- You can protect your child by:\n  - getting rid of the dust\n  - taking your shoes off inside your home\n  - reducing the amount of clutter in your house\n  - storing toys in closed containers\n- Pregnant women should avoid changing vacuum bags.\n\n## Cleaning Products\n\n- Many cleaning products contain [toxic chemicals ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://healthyenvironmentforkids.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GreenClean-Rack-Card-Eng.pdf \"PDF Document\").\n- These chemicals can increase the chance of health problems in children.\n- Children can be exposed to toxic chemicals through:\n  - swallowing by touching surfaces with cleaning product residue and unknowingly transferring into their mouth\n  - breathing in fumes from cleaning products\n  - absorbing cleaning products through their skin by touching them\n- Many of these toxic chemicals can cross the placenta and reach the fetus during pregnancy and can cause health problems such as wheezing and asthma in children later in life.\n- You can protect your child by:\n  - using non-toxic cleaning products\n  - avoiding fragranced products\n  - keeping all cleaning products out of the reach of children\n\n## Mercury in Fish\n\n- Mercury is found naturally in rocks and soils and can leak into fish habitats in lakes and streams. The bigger the fish, the higher the concentration of mercury.\n- Mercury exposure is harmful during fetal and childhood development because it can affect the brain and nervous system.\n- Children can be exposed to mercury through:\n  - swallowing by eating fish that contains mercury.\n  - breathing in toxin fumes from work places where mercury is used (industry, mining), silver dental filings, broken products that contain mercury (glass thermometers, batteries)\n- You can protect your child by choosing [fish that is low in mercury](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/health-wellness-care/health-programs-advice/fish-and-mercury/).\n\n## Plastics\n\n- Plastic is made of many different chemicals, some are harmful.\n- Exposure to these harmful chemicals as a fetus or young child can impact brain development.\n- There are three types of harmful plastics:\n1. Phthalates: used to make plastic flexible and labelled polyvinyl chloride (PVC) on products. It is found in soft plastic toys, teething rings and personal care products.\n2. Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs): chemicals that evaporate into the air, giving off a \u201cnew plastic\u201d smell. It is found in toys, cleaners, shower curtains, air fresheners and paint.\n3. Bisphenol\u2013A (BPA): used to make hard clear plastic. It is found in reusable water bottles and the lining of food and beverage cans.\n\n- Children can be exposed to harmful plastic chemicals through:\n  - swallowing by chewing or sucking on plastic items, eating or drinking items that have been heated in plastic\n  - breathing in vapours from new plastic material such as flooring or shower curtains\n- You can protect your child by:\n  - not using plastic in the microwave\n  - storing food in glass containers\n  - choosing fresh or frozen food instead of canned\n  - avoiding teething rings, toys and other items that contain PVCs, VOCs and BPAs\n\n## Home Renovations\n\n- Paints, solvents and dust caused by home renovations may have harmful chemicals and fumes. These chemicals can cause breathing problems and affect the brain of children and developing fetus.\n- Indoor paint made before 1980 and outdoor paint made before 1990 may contain lead.\n- Children can be exposed through:\n  - swallowing lead contaminated paint chips and dust, chewing old painted items\n  - breathing in fumes from freshly applied paint and painting products such as paint thinners, breathing in lead contaminated dust and [mould](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/health-wellness-care/health-programs-advice/mould/)\n- Children and pregnant women should stay away from areas being renovated.\n\n## Second and Third-Hand Tobacco Smoke\n\nSecond-hand smoke is the smoke from the end of a burning cigarette and the smoke that is exhaled by the person smoking the cigarette.\n\n- There is no safe level of exposure to second-hand smoke.\n\nThird-hand smoke is the toxic chemicals and tiny particles that stay on surfaces and in household dust after a cigarette is smoked (For example, smoke that gets trapped in hair, skin, walls, fabric, carpet, furniture and toys)\n\n- Infants and children take in more chemicals from second-hand smoke because they breathe more quickly and have smaller lungs.\n- Children exposed to second-hand smoke are at greater risk for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), pneumonia, bronchitis and asthma.\n- Children can be exposed through:\n  - breathing in second-hand smoke\n  - swallowing by touching surfaces that have chemicals from third-hand smoke and transferring to their mouth especially when playing or crawling on the floor\n- You can protect your child by not allowing smoking in your home or car.\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=9wrj2qixotd8)",

Tossed butts start fires.\"](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/974d-tossed-butts-start-fires-poster-350x541.jpg)Lit cigarette butts can smoulder for hours before starting a fire.\n\nTossing your butt off the balcony may feel like the easiest way to get rid of your cigarette, but it can also be the easiest way to start a fire.\n\nWhen you flick a lit butt off a balcony, you probably assume it will land on the street below. Not always. The wind can blow your cigarette butt onto another balcony where it can land in a dry flower pot, on combustible material or in between outdoor couch cushions. And before you know it, your building could be on fire.\n\nStop fires before they start. Make sure you put your cigarette butt right out when you\u2019re done smoking. And don\u2019t toss your butt off your balcony.\n\nDownload:\u00a0[Smoking Safety Poster #1 ![(opens in new window)](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/9659-tossed-butts-start-fires-poster.pdf \"PDF Document\") \\| [Smoking Safety Poster #2 ![(opens in new window)](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/959a-tossed-butts-start-fires-poster-2.pdf \"PDF Document\")\n\nExpand All Smoking Safety accordion panelsCollapse All Smoking Safety accordion panels\n\n## Smoking-Related Fire Facts\n\n- In 2017, 114 fires in Toronto were started by lit cigarette butts and 49 of those\u00a0were balcony fires.\n- In 2018, 122 fires in Toronto were started by lit cigarette butts and 42 of those\u00a0were balcony fires.\n- In 2019, 121 fires in Toronto were started by lit cigarette butts and 33 of those\u00a0were balcony fires.\n- In 2020, 111 fires in Toronto were started by lit cigarette butts and 44 of those\u00a0were balcony fires.\n- In 2021, 89 fires in Toronto were started by lit cigarette butts and 31 of those\u00a0were balcony fires.\n- In 2022, 104 fires in Toronto were started by lit cigarette butts and 49 of those\u00a0were balcony fires.\n\n## Stop Fires Before They Start\n\n- Make sure you stub your cigarette butt out completely when you\u2019re done smoking.\n- Don\u2019t toss your butt off the balcony.\n- Dispose of your butt by:\n  - putting it in a sturdy ashtray with a wide, stable base or a can filled with sand to collect the ashes.\n  - Soak cigarette butts and ashes in water before throwing them away.\n- Don\u2019t smoke when you\u2019re tired or consuming alcohol and there\u2019s a danger you could fall asleep while smoking.\n\nToronto Fire Services: Don't Be a Flicking Idiot Campaign - YouTube\n\nthecityoftoronto\n\n21.9K subscribers\n\n[Toronto Fire Services: Don't Be a Flicking Idiot Campaign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUDFV0M_Z-c)\n\nthecityoftoronto\n\nSearch\n\nWatch later\n\nShare\n\nCopy link\n\nInfo\n\nShopping\n\nTap to unmute\n\nIf playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device.\n\nMore videos\n\n## More videos\n\nYou're signed out\n\nVideos you watch may be added to the TV's watch history and influence TV recommendations.

Talk to your doctor about this activity and your health status before winter season arrives.\n\nThink twice if you\n\n- have had a heart attack or have other forms of heart disease\n- have high blood pressure or high cholesterol level\n- are a smoker\n- lead a sedentary lifestyle\n\n## Tips\n\n- Consider hiring a student or using a volunteer service if you are a senior\n- Shovel at least 1\u20132 hours after eating, and avoid caffeine and nicotine\n- Warm up first (walk or march in place for several minutes before beginning)\n- Start slow and continue at a slow pace (Suggestion: shovel for 5\u20137 minutes and rest 2\u20133 minutes)\n- Drink lots of water to prevent dehydration\n- Shovel early and often\n- New snow is lighter than heavily packed/partially melted snow\n- Take frequent breaks\n\n## Tools\n\n- Shovel\n  - Sturdy yet lightweight is best (a small plastic blade is better than a large metal blade)\n  - An ergonomically correct model (curved handle) will help prevent injury and fatigue\n  - Spray the blade with a silicone-based lubricant (snow does not stick and slides off)\n- Clothing\n  - Wear multiple layers and cover as much skin as possible\n  - Wear a hat and scarf (make sure neither block your vision)\n  - Wear mittens (tend to be warmer than gloves)\n  - Wear boots with non-skid/no-slip rubber soles\n\n## Technique\n\n- Push the snow\u00a0rather than lifting\n- Protect your back by lifting properly and safely: Stand with feet at hip width for balance\n- Hold the shovel close to your body\n- Space hands apart to increase leverage\n- Bend from your knees, not your back\n- Tighten your stomach muscles while lifting\n- Avoid twisting while lifting\n- Walk to dump snow rather than throwing it\n- When snow is deep, shovel small amounts (1\u20132 inches at a time) at a time\n- If the ground is icy or slippery, spread salt, sand or cat litter to create better foot traction\n\n## Knowledge\n\n- Shovelling snow is strenuous activity that is very stressful on the heart\n- Exhaustion makes you more susceptible to frostbite, injury and hypothermia\n- Stop shovelling and call 9\u20111\u20111 if you have\n  - discomfort or heaviness in the chest, arms or neck\n  - unusual or prolonged shortness of breath\n  - a dizzy or faint feeling\n  - excessive sweating or nausea and vomiting\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=4dk2pr85i74t)\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\nPCFET0NUWVBFIGh0bWw PGJvZHk 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",

Many of them happen in public places. If you saw someone suffering a sudden cardiac arrest, would you know what to do?\n\nLearning first aid, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and how to use an automated external defibrillator (AED) will give you the skills you need to help a paramedic save a life in a medical emergency.\n\nToronto Paramedic Services\u2019 Safe City program maintains over 1,500 AEDs in public places like TTC subway stations, police stations, community centres, rinks, pools, and some schools. Knowing what to do ahead of the medical emergency will allow you to contribute to saving a life.\n\nSeveral bystanders a year step forward to help save a life in three easy steps:\n\n1. Call 9\u20111\u20111 for the paramedics.\n2. Start CPR:\n   - Push hard and fast on the person\u2019s chest to the beat of the song \u201cStayin\u2019 Alive\u201d (100\u2013125 beats per minute)\n3. In a public place, ask for the AED (or public access defibrillator). Follow the instructions, administer a life-saving shock if necessary.\n\nTaking a [Toronto Paramedic Services CPR/First Aid course](https://www.toronto.ca/?page_id=26128) will help you to help someone in a medical emergency.\n\nToronto Paramedic Services Safe City Program: 416-392-9833, or email: [emscpr@toronto.ca](mailto:emscpr@toronto.ca)\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=m61sucnmqz36)\n\nPCFET0NUWVBFIGh0bWw PGJvZHk 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",

Community PEERS was developed in response to youth violence prevention supports requested from community stakeholders and frontline workers across Toronto.\n\nAll Peer Support Workers in Community PEERS have received a certified, 12-week Peer Support Training through [The Community Healing Project](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/public-safety-alerts/community-safety-programs/community-healing-project/), have lived experiences of community violence exposure, and practical experiences of working with youth vulnerable to involvement in serious violence and crime.\n\nAs a response to emerging healing opportunities for communities, training requests for frontline workers, and mental health/safety needs of communities and young people vulnerable to involvement in violence and/or crime, Community PEERS engages Peer Support Workers to offer violence prevention services to communities.\n\nPeer Support Workers continue to develop their skills and expertise through ongoing coaching, training, job placements, and community of practice sessions while engaged in Community PEERS.\n\nTo access services through Community PEERS, please contact Asmaa Mohamed at [Asmaa.Mohamed@toronto.ca](mailto:Asmaa.Mohamed@toronto.ca)\n\nIntegrated Supports for Justice Involved Youth\n\n\n### Delivered in Partnership with Amadeusz\n\nProject Prosper aims to provide young people who have been incarcerated for firearm possession related charges with the tools, relationships, opportunities and access to services to support them in having a successful transition back to the community. The ultimate goal is to reduce participants\u2019 risk of involvement in future crime and violence.\n\nParticipants work with a Case Worker to identify the issues that they feel would help them create positive change in their lives, and to create a plan of support to address any needs including income, education, legal, employment, health, family, life skills, mentorship and resources for personal development. The Case Worker is intended to be a consistent, caring adult in participants\u2019 lives.\n\nThe project was developed based on a research project conducted by Humber College in partnership with [Amadeusz ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](http://amadeusz.ca/), The City of Toronto \u2013 Toronto Youth Equity Strategy and the Laidlaw Foundation. The research included interviews with local youth who have been incarcerated for firearm possession charges, as well as national and international evidence on the causes, and solutions for addressing gun violence. The evidence is clear that we must support young people to get the support that can help them make a successful transition back to the community.\n\n### Delivered in Partnership with Fernie Youth Services\n\n[Fernie Youth Services ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://fernieyouth.ca/) provides rehabilitative, community based service for young adults (ages 18-29) who have been referred through Probation & Parole \u2013 Toronto Anti-Gangs & Guns Unit. The TYES Support Services program provides case management support to 40-50 youth/young adults annually, through a youth-centred, trauma informed, strength based, holistic and tailored service to meet the individual goals, strengths, needs, circumstances and preferences of each participant.\n\nThe Case Managers will develop partnerships with City services and organizations that can support the needs of the client. The Case Managers seek to reduce recidivism and support individuals\u2019 through a holistic approach that considers each person\u2019s overall needs. Participants are supported through a Fernie Case Manager works with participants, and others from the participants support team to complete a Needs Assessment and Service Plan. The Service Plan sets out individualized goals that may include; living in a stable environment, improving relationships with family and positive friends, engaging in school and/or employment, participating in recreational activities, improving physical and mental health, addressing drug any drug or alcohol issues, learning new life skills and addressing their involvement in the criminal justice system.\n\nRestorative Justice Programs (RJP)\n\n\nRestorative Justice is a means to repair harm caused to people, relationships and communities through collective participation in resolutions. Through this program, youth participants will be able to identify issues that cause harm, be exposed to strategies to cope and manage conflicts, understand accountability and actively participate in resolutions\n\nThe Youth Violence Prevention team at the City of Toronto is currently working with community groups to implement Restorative Justice Programs in St. Jamestown, Danzig, Jane and Lawrence, and Sparroways.\n\n### Enhanced Restorative Justice Programs\n\nWhile maintaining the core values and principles, Enhanced Restorative Justice Programs bring a holistic approach and focus on deeper resolution strategies such as accessible education, wraparound supports, community engagement, and enhancing youth spaces to mitigate violence that youth are facing in communities across Toronto.\n\nThe Youth Equity and Violence Prevention team at the City of Toronto is currently working with community groups to implement Enhanced Restorative Justice Programs in Jane and Finch (Westview High School), Jane and Finch (Driftwood), and Scarborough (Woburn).\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=qj9jvkrxud31)\n\nPCFET0NUWVBFIGh0bWw PGJvZHk 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",

        "markdown": "![City of Toronto](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/themes/cot/img/logo-print.svg)\n\n# Automatic Sprinklers\n\nAutomatic sprinkler systems have enjoyed an enviable record of protecting life and property for over 100 years. Statistics demonstrate that there has never been a multiple loss of life in a fully sprinklered building where the system operated as designed. Sprinklers are a cost-effective technology that provides for a high level of life safety. Residential fire sprinkler technology is proving both reliable and effective. Property losses are 85% less in residences with fire sprinklers compared to those without. As positive as this information is however, there are still common misunderstandings about the operation and effectiveness of home fire sprinkler systems. The following are some of the more common myths:\n\nExpand All Automatic Sprinklers accordion panelsCollapse All Automatic Sprinklers accordion panels\n\n## Myth 1: \"Water damage from a sprinkler system will be more extensive than fire damage\"\n\n**Fact:** Water damage from a home sprinkler system will be much less severe than the damage caused by water from fire-fighting hose lines or smoke and fire damage if the fire goes unabated. Quick response sprinklers release approximately 30-90 litres (8-24 gallons) of water per minute compared to 190-473 litres (50-125 gallons) per minute released by a fire hose.\n\n## Myth 2: \"When a fire activates one sprinkler head, all sprinkler heads will activate\"\n\n**Fact:** Residential sprinklers respond independently to a rated temperature setting of approximately 74 degrees Celsius (165 degrees Fahrenheit). Usually, only one sprinkler is activated to extinguish or limit the fire to its room of origin.\n\n## Myth 3: \"Sprinklers might activate by accident\"\n\n**Fact:** The odds of accidental discharge due to a manufacturing defect are 1 in 16 million per year.\n\n## Myth 4: \"A sprinkler system might freeze in winter and cause water damage\"\n\n**Fact:** Much like your plumbing system, your sprinkler system piping is installed on inside walls adjacent to the ceiling framing and then insulated to entrap the available heat lost from the living area below.\n\n## Myth 5: \"A smoke alarm on its own offers adequate protection\"\n\n**Fact:** Smoke alarms will save lives by providing a much-needed early warning system. However, smoke alarms do nothing to extinguish a growing fire. Too often, battery operated smoke alarms fail to function because of dead or missing batteries. In order for smoke alarms to be effective in saving lives, they must be working and they must be maintained on a regular basis.\n\n## Myth 6: \"I can't afford a sprinkler system\"\n\n**Fact:** This is generally a statement of priority. We rarely hesitate when buying a more comfortable couch, plusher carpet, the latest stereo equipment or an upgraded computer. A sprinkler system can be installed in a new home for as little as $1.50 per square foot which, in many cases, would represent less than 2% of the total construction cost. System installation in existing homes is simple but more expensive.\n\n## Myth 7: \"Sprinkler Systems are unattractive\"\n\n**Fact:** Fire damage is unattractive. Quick response residential sprinkler systems are designed to save your life by providing attractive ceiling and side mount sprinkler heads that blend unobtrusively into your room decor. Sprinklers, cover plates, and escutcheons can be custom painted by the manufacturer to match any decor.\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=15fwwha8ax9)\n\nPCFET0NUWVBFIGh0bWw PGJvZHk 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",

Just to make it easy, you should be answering yes to all of the following questions. If you answer no, have a closer look at the item to see if that is really how you wish to handle the situation.\n\nAt Home\n\n\n- Do you keep doors and windows locked at all times?\n- Do you have a peephole so that you can see who is outside without having to open the door?\n- Do you verify a person\u2019s identification before opening the door?\n- If a stranger asks to use your phone, do you refuse to let them into your home and offer to make the call yourself?\n- Do you, as a woman living alone, use your first initials only in telephone directories, on mailboxes, etc.?\n- Do you refuse to reveal personal information to anyone on the phone or at your door?\n- Do you always have your keys ready when approaching your home?\n- If you return home to find windows and doors tampered with, would you avoid entering and go to a neighbour\u2019s house to call the police?\n\nOn the Phone\n\n\n- Do you teach family members not to give personal or family information to strangers over the phone?\n- Do you instruct older children who are babysitting or the babysitter to always say that you are at home, but busy and so they will take a message?\n- Do you record only non-specific messages on your answering machine and avoid messages such as: \u201cWe\u2019ll be back around 7 o\u2019clock on Sunday\u201d?\n- Do you use the telephone company\u2019s \u2018Caller ID\u2019 feature?\n- If you receive an obscene or crank call, would you hang up immediately, saying nothing?\n\nOn the Go\n\n\n- Do you plan in advance the safest route to your destination?\n- Do you choose busy, well-lit streets?\n- Do you avoid routes that pass by high-risk areas?\n- Do you avoid isolated bus stops?\n- Do you walk facing traffic so you can see approaching cars?\n- Do you walk near the curb to avoid the element of surprise or someone hiding between shrubs or in a doorway?\n- Do you stay out of reach if someone in a vehicle asks directions?\n- Are you wary of approaching strangers?\n- If you continue to be followed, do you flee to the nearest safe place?\n- Do you try to get a description of the person and/or vehicle following you?\n- Do you avoid carrying large sums of money in your purse or wallet?\n- Do you carry your purse close to your body, without wrapping the straps around your arm or hand?\n- Do you avoid leaving a purse unattended, even for a moment?\n- Do you avoid displaying large amounts of cash in public?\n\nIn Your Car\n\n\n- Do you always lock your car doors while driving?\n- Do you keep windows rolled up whenever possible?\n- Do you avoid picking up hitchhikers?\n- Do you keep your car in good running order to avoid breakdowns in dangerous areas?\n- Do you look for well-lit areas to park your car?\n- Do you always lock your car when it is parked?\n- Do you look around the car before you get out, especially at night or in deserted areas such as underground parking lots?\n- When returning to your car, do you have your keys in hand?\n- Do you look in the back seat before getting into the car?\n- If you are being followed, do you avoid going home and go to the nearest place of safety instead?\n\nPlaces of Public Assembly\n\n\n#### Before you enter\n\n- Take a good look. Does the building you enter appear to be in a condition that makes you feel comfortable? Is the main entrance wide and does it open outward to allow easy exit? Is the outside area clear of materials stored against the building or blocking exits?\n- Have a communication plan. \u00a0Identify a relative or friend to contact in case of emergency and you are separated from family or friends.\n- Plan a meeting place. \u00a0Pick a meeting place outside to meet family or friends with whom you are attending the function. If there is an emergency, be sure to meet them there.\n\n#### When you enter\n\n- Take a good look. Locate exits immediately. When you enter a building you should look for all available exits. Some exits may be in front and some in back of you. Be prepared to use your closest exit. You may not be able to use the main exit.\n- Check for clear exit paths. \u00a0Make sure aisles are wide enough and not obstructed by chairs or furniture. Check to make sure your exit door is not blocked or chained. If there are not at least two exits or exit paths are blocked, report the violation to management and leave the building if it is not immediately addressed.\n- Do you feel safe? \u00a0Does the building appear to be overcrowded? Are there fire sources such as candles burning, cigarettes or cigars burning, pyrotechnics, or other heat sources that make you feel unsafe? If you do not feel safe in the building, leave immediately.\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=57wmit5fgf9a)\n\nPCFET0NUWVBFIGh0bWw PGJvZHk 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",

        "markdown": "![City of Toronto](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/themes/cot/img/logo-print.svg)\n\n# High-Rise Fire Safety\n\nThe following information is a general guide for high-rise buildings. Since each building is unique, you should learn the approved \u201cFire Safety Plan\u201d specifically designed for your building.\n\n[Owners: What services can Toronto Emergency Services provide for your building](https://www.toronto.ca/?page_id=22307)\n\nExpand All High-Rise Fire Safety accordion panelsCollapse All High-Rise Fire Safety accordion panels\n\n## What Is A High-Rise Building?\n\nThe Ontario Building Code defines Residential \u201chigh-rise buildings\u201d as those being seven storeys or more in height or more specifically the floor level of the highest storey of that major occupancy is more than 18 m above grade.\n\n## High-Rise Buildings Are Designed To Be Safe\n\n- High-rise buildings are designed to be more fire-safe than an average single-family dwelling. Floors and ceilings are constructed with fire-resistant materials and are separated into fire compartments. The compartments act as barriers to resist fire from spreading. Floors, walls, and ceilings provide a barrier against the spread of fire, and suite doors must close automatically to protect openings.\n- High-rise buildings have interior fire-separated stairwell shafts. Signs should be posted within stairwells indicating which floor level you are on, and also identify the nearest crossover floors, if certain floors are not accessible. Keep stairwell doors closed at all times to preserve the safety of these escape stairs. Every floor has access to at least 2 separate exit stairways which provide a protected path to the exterior.\n- High-rise buildings contain a fire alarm system designed to alert occupants when activated. Types of fire alarm devices include smoke detectors, thermal detectors and sprinkler flow switches. A fire alarm system provides early warning to occupants of a fire condition.\n- Modern High-rise buildings often have a voice communication system, used by supervisory personnel to make announcements about fire location and conditions.\n- Some High-rise buildings have sprinkler systems to put water directly on the source of the fire. High-rise buildings also contain a standpipe system, that is an interior water supply system of fire hose cabinets on each floor for use by firefighters. Most buildings also have portable fire extinguishers in these cabinets.\n\n## Fire Safety Begins With You\n\nLearn what to do if a fire happens in your building. This is the best way to protect yourself and those around you.\n\n- Talk to your landlord, superintendent or building manager.\n- Know the emergency procedures outlined in the building\u2019s fire safety plan.\n- Create a home escape plan and practice it with everyone in your home.\n- Every fire is different. You must act quickly when you hear the alarm or discover a fire.\n- Remember, most people die from the smoke, not the fire.\n\nHigh-rise buildings are designed to be fire-safe. But, because they may contain many people, and because of the building\u2019s tremendous size, emergency response is challenging with significant potential for major incidents.\n\nDue to equipment limitations, firefighters cannot rescue people from an outside balcony or window above the seventh floor. Also, a rooftop helicopter rescue is too dangerous. Firefighters must do interior firefighting and rescue tactics.\n\n## If There Is A Fire In Your Suite\n\nIf there is a fire in your suite, it is not safe to stay inside! Stay away from poisonous smoke!\n\n- Everyone evacuate immediately.\n- Close, but don\u2019t lock, all doors behind you.\n- Pull the red fire alarm pull station next to the stairwell on your floor and yell \u201cfire\u201d.\n- Leave the building using the nearest exit stairway.\n- Do not use the elevator.\n- Never go to the roof, smoke rises! Doors to the roof are locked and you could become trapped.\n- Call the fire department at 9-1-1 from a safe location. (Never assume this has been done).\n- Meet the firefighters when they arrive and tell them where the fire is.\n- Once out, stay out.\n- Do not go back into the building until the fire department tells you it\u2019s safe.\n\n## When You Hear The Building Fire Alarm\n\nStay in your suite (if safe to do so) until you are rescued or until you are told to leave.\n\n1. If the fire is NOT in your suite, you are typically safe to remain there. Your suite walls, floors, and ceilings are composed of non-combustible construction and will protect you from smoke and fire.\n2. Keep smoke from entering your suite. Use duct tape to seal cracks around the door and place wet towels at the bottom. Seal vents or air ducts the same way. See a recommended \u201cHigh-Rise Survival Kit\u201d below.\n\nIf smoke does start to enter your suite (and you are unable to evacuate).\n\n1. Call the fire department at 9-1-1 and tell them where you are and then move to the balcony. Close the doors behind you.\n2. If you don\u2019t have a balcony, go to the most smoke-free room, close the door and seal it with wide tape and towels. If necessary, open the window for fresh air. Show emergency personnel where you are by hanging a\n\n\nsheet from the window or balcony.\n3. Keep low to the floor where the air is cleaner.\n4. Listen for instructions from authorities.\n\n## High-Rise Survival Kit\n\nThe Toronto Fire Services recommends a high-rise survival kit for tenants of high buildings, readily available if they become trapped during a fire. You can purchase the following list of items for less than $50. Having these items available for emergency use may improve your chances of surviving a fire.\n\n- **Wet towel** \u2013 Place at the base of a door.\n- **Duct tape** \u2013 Tape over door and vent openings.\n- **Foil wrap** \u2013 Use to cover vent openings.\n- **Whistle** \u2013 Use to signal for help.\n- **Flashlight** \u2013 Use in case of power failure, smoke, or to signal for help.\n- **Bright-coloured cloth** \u2013 Hang up in a window, or on a balcony, to identify your location.\n- **Ink marker** \u2013 Use for messages on cloth, door or windows.\n- **Cotton bedsheet** \u2013 If smoke is heavy in your room, soak the bed sheet with water and make a tent near an open window.\n- **Washcloth** \u2013 Place the wet cloth over your mouth and nose to aid breathing in smoke-filled areas.\n- **Fire safety plan** \u2013 Have a copy of your building\u2019s emergency procedures available.\n- **Plastic pail with lid** \u2013 Use for storing survival equipment.

Initially an incident can be upgraded to a working fire response by a dispatcher, based upon the numerous 911 calls received and the detail provided by the public. Alternatively it may be upgraded once TFS arrives on scene and sees smoke or they receive a report from persons on site. If these conditions were not present initially, an Alarm Level may still be upgraded based upon the size and duration of the fire, rotation of crews due to extreme hot or cold weather conditions, numbers and disabilities of people within the structure, or additional specialized apparatus and crews required.\n\n- Alarm Level 0 = initial response (for any event)\n- Alarm Level 1 = support fire response\n\nAlarms levels below are determined by the amount of vehicles (consisting of Pumpers, Aerials, Rescues and Squads) responding to the event.

        "markdown": "![City of Toronto](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/themes/cot/img/logo-print.svg)\n\n# After an Emergency\n\nLeaving your home because of an emergency is upsetting and it is easy to forget important details for helping yourself. Here are some things that may help you:\n\n- Contact family and friends to let them know you are safe.\n- Contact your insurance company immediately.\n- Make plans for food, shelter and clothing \u2013 contact family and friends to see if they can help.\n- Tell your employer or school what your situation is.\n- Cancel appointments.\n- Tell your children\u2019s school what happened.\n\nExpand All After an Emergency accordion panelsCollapse All After an Emergency accordion panels\n\n## If Additional Help is Needed\n\nToronto Emergency Management can provide emergency help to people forced to leave their home because of an emergency.\n\nHelp might include an assessment and referral to services you might need like help with food, shelter, clothes, transportation, finding your family and emotional support.\n\nSometimes a place (reception centre) may be set up nearby where you can get more information about available services. Staff will be able to direct you to the correct place for more help.\n\n### Keeping You Updated\n\nStaff will do their best to give you up-to-date information. They know that keeping you informed will help you with frustration, anger or anxiety you might be feeling.\n\n## Immediate Needs\n\nIf you have insurance, it may cover the cost of your immediate needs. If you don\u2019t have insurance, or are having difficulty accessing insurance coverage, the City of Toronto can make sure you have a short-term place to stay.\\*\n\nThere is also help with food, clothes, transportation, finding your family and emotional support if you need it. You\u2019ll have to fill out a registration form to get the services. The people at the reception centre will help you.\n\n### Emergency Accommodation for Service Animals and Pets\n\nIf you do not have a place to stay, City staff will try to find you a place where you can stay with your pet(s).\n\nNot all places let you take your pet(s) so people with guide or service animals get priority. Your pets might need to stay at a kennel or a veterinarian until you can stay together again.\n\n\\\\* Accommodation assistance can be arranged for up to 14 days. Extended assistance may\u00a0be available beyond 14 days, if you meet the criteria. The criteria is based on the low\u00a0income cut off (annual income before taxes as established by Statistics Canada).\n\n## Helping Yourself and Others\n\nWhile it\u2019s natural to feel anxious after a crisis, it\u2019s important to take care of yourself. You can help yourself by talking to others, asking for help when you need it and sharing information about assistance and resources.\n\nYou can help others by being patient when stress causes them to be short tempered or irritable. If you or someone in your family has a very difficult reaction or your reaction continues for a long time, it\u2019s important to get help. Staff can assist you with locating the correct resources to help you.\n\n## Returning Home\n\nAfter an emergency:\n\n- Check in and around your home for damage.\n- Dispose of any spoiled or contaminated foods, especially after a power outage. If you\u2019re not sure, throw it out.\n- Encourage family members to talk about their experience and their feelings, especially children.\n- Contact other family members to let them know that you are safe.\n\n## Check for Damaged Utilities\n\n### Natural Gas\n\nNatural gas is colourless, odourless and non-poisonous. Natural gas has no odour so a rotten egg smell is added for your safety. If you smell natural gas:\n\n- Open doors and windows.\n- Call Enbridge Gas Distribution at 1-866-763-5427.\n- Don\u2019t use your telephone or cellular phone. Call from a neighbour\u2019s phone.\n- Don\u2019t turn any electrical switches, appliances or computers on or off.\n- Don\u2019t smoke or use lighters or matches, or start any motors near the leak.\n\n### Electrical\n\nCheck for damage such as frayed wires, sparks or the smell of hot insulation:\n\n- Don\u2019t operate electrical switches or appliances.\n- Turn off the system at the main fuse box/breaker panel.\n\n### Water\n\nCheck for leaks:\n\n- Shut off water at the main valve where the water pipe enters your home.\n\n**Do not turn on the gas, electricity or water until your utility provider has investigated and confirmed that it is safe to do so.**\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=1zaoebay45tc)\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate",

Process and Re-inspection Fees\n\nToronto Fire Services\u2019 (TFS) fire prevention and enforcement strategies aim to increase public safety and awareness. TFS is guided by the Fire Protection and Prevention Act, 1997 (FPPA) and regulations under the FPPA, like the Ontario Fire Code.\n\nRe-inspections are required to ensure Fire Code compliance when violations have been identified during the first inspection.\n\nOverview of the Process that will fall in to one of three inspection streams:\n\n1\\. Deficiencies are noted and time is given to achieve Compliance\n\n- If a building is non-compliant with the Fire Code, the Inspector may issue the property owner a Notice of Violation.\u00a0 Where a Notice of Violation is issued the Inspector will return to complete the inspection process and confirm that violations have been fixed and the building is now compliant with the Fire Code.\n- If all the violations are fixed when the Inspector returns to the building to complete the inspection process there will be no need for re-inspections and therefore no re-inspection fee.\n- The re-inspection fee shall be charged for all subsequent re-inspections if any violations from the Notice of Violation remain outstanding when the Inspector returns to the building.\n- For example, an Inspector notes 10 deficiencies on a Notice of Violation after an initial inspection. If all 10 deficiencies are rectified when the Inspector returns to the building there will be no re-inspection fee. The Inspector may return to the building and find that 8 of the deficiencies have been rectified. This re-inspection will not generate a fee. A re-inspection must be completed to confirm that the remaining 2 deficiencies have been rectified. This subsequent re-inspection will generate a fee.\n- When an Order is issued, an Inspector will re-attend, at no fee, to confirm the deficiencies have been rectified as specified in the Order. If deficiencies remain outstanding, subsequent re-inspections will result in a re-inspection fee being charged until the fire hazards are eliminated.\n\n2\\. Immediate Charges apply\n\n- If an Inspector lays charges for Fire Code violations, all re-inspections to ensure compliance with the Fire Code will have a re-inspection fee.\n- Since no grace period is given for an owner to rectify deficiencies, there is no exemption available for the re-inspection fee.\n\n3\\. Request Inspections\n\n- All \u201cRequested Inspections\u201d are charged a flat fee. The flat fee covers the first visit, along with two potential subsequent re-inspections for completing the specified process. If the process is not complete after the first inspection and two re-inspections, the applicable re-inspection fee will be charged for each additional re-inspection required.\n\nAdditional considerations:\n\n- There will be a minimum fee of one hour for any portion of an hour. If Inspectors are in attendance for a prolonged period of time over one hour, additional hourly charges will be incurred.\n- There is no limit to the amount of time to complete an initial inspection. In some cases a complex building such as a hospital can involve several weeks.\n- No fee will be charged to the property owner for re-inspections that take place prior to July 1st 2017.\n- TFS will continue to provide the first Fire Code inspection at no cost.\n- Re-inspection fees apply when an Inspector conducts a Fire Prevention re-inspection arising from a pro-active risk based inspection, vulnerable occupancy, request or complaint inspection, as outlined under Reference number 113 Toronto Municipal Code Chapter 441 Fees and Charges, Appendix B \u2013 Schedule 1, Fire Services.\n\n**Additional Fees Charged in Complex Circumstances:**\n\n- In complex circumstances where supervisory staff is required to assist with enforcement of the Fire Code, additional fees will apply. Supervisory staff includes a Captain and/or a District Chief.\n  - If a supervisor is required to attend with an Inspector, fees will be charged to cover the cost of service provided by both the Inspector and the Captain.\n  - If the Inspector, Captain and supervising District Chief are required to attend fees will be charged for the Inspector, Captain, and District Chief.\n  - Captain and/or District Chief re-inspection fees are outlined under Reference number 114 and 115 Toronto Municipal Code Chapter 441 Fees and Charges, Appendix B \u2013 Schedule 1, Fire Services.\n\n**Achieving Compliance and Avoiding Re-Inspection Fees:**\n\n- Property owners are responsible to maintain buildings that meet the Ontario Fire Code. Taking immediate action to have deficiencies rectified, will increase life safety and will result in fewer Ontario Fire Code violations.\n- TFS will clearly document Ontario Fire Code violations through a Notice of Violation or Order so that property owners can take appropriate action before a Fire Inspector returns to conduct a re-inspection.\n\n**Invoicing:**\n\n- An invoice will be sent to the property owner indicating the date of the re-inspection and the associated fee.\n- For inquiries, please call 416- 338-9148 or email\u00a0[fireaccounting@toronto.ca](mailto:fireaccounting@toronto.ca)\n\n**Public Meetings:**\n\nToronto Fire Services (TFS) hosted a series of public meetings to provide property owners with an overview of the new re-inspection process and associated fees. Meetings were held June 21, 22, 26 and 27 2017 at the Scarborough Civic Centre, Fire Services Headquarters, Etobicoke Civic Centre and Metro Hall.\n\n## Contact Information\n\n### All Questions, Excluding Re-Inspection Fees\n\nFor any questions other than Re-Inspection fees, contact a Fire Prevention Command office near you:\n\n#### North Command\n\n**Wards**: 6-York Centre, 8-Eglinton-Lawrence, 15-Don Valley West, 16-Don Valley East, 17-Don Valley North, 18-Willowdale\n\n5100 Yonge St.\n\nToronto, ON\n\nM2N 5V7\n\nPhone: 416-338-9150\n\n#### East Command\n\n**Wards:** 14-Toronto-Danforth , 19-Beaches-East York, 20-Scarborough Southwest, 21-Scarborough Centre, 22-Scarborough-Agincourt, 23-Scarborough North, 24-Scarborough-Guildwood, 25-Scarborough-Rouge Park\n\n150 Borough Dr.\n\nToronto, ON\n\nM1P 4N7\n\nPhone: 416-338-9250\n\n#### South Command\n\n**Wards:** 9-Davenport, 10-Spadina-Fort York, 11-University-Rosedale, 12-Toronto-St. Paul\u2019s, 13-Toronto Centre\n\nCity Hall Gr Fl, W.,100 Queen St.West\n\nToronto, ON\n\nM5H 2N2\n\nPhone: 416-338-9350\n\n#### West Command\n\n**Wards:** 1-Etobicoke North, 2-Etobicoke Centre, 3-Etobicoke-Lakeshore, 4-Parkdale-High Park, 5-York South-Weston, 7-Humber River-Black Creek\n\n399 The West Mall\n\nToronto, ON\n\nM9C 2Y2\n\nPhone: 416-338-9450\n\n### Inquiries About Fire Code Enforcement Re-Inspection Fees\n\nFor inquiries, please call 416-338-9148 or email [fireaccounting@toronto.ca](mailto:fireaccounting@toronto.ca).\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=k9f7axpyjkat)",

The program increases the level of support available to clients by aiding with system navigation and helps manage recurrent medical emergencies that may lead to frequent 911 use and/or Emergency Department (ED) visits.\n\nCommunity Paramedics have become an integral part of the healthcare system, identifying and addressing gaps in community-based healthcare, and have been an invaluable resource throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nToronto Paramedic Services offers the following Community Paramedicine programs for residents and visitors of the City of Toronto.\n\nExpand All Community Paramedicine Program accordion panelsCollapse All Community Paramedicine Program accordion panels\n\n## Community Referrals by Emergency Medical Services\n\nToronto Paramedic Services\u2019 Community Referrals by Emergency Medical Services (CREMS) program was established in 2006 and enables Paramedics while responding to 911 calls to identify clients that would benefit from additional support managing their healthcare at home. While on scene, Paramedics are uniquely positioned to identify additional medical and/or social needs for their patients. When needs are identified, responding Paramedics submit a referral outlining the barriers experienced by the client, based on information gathered at the time of the 911 call. Depending on the information provided, clients are either referred directly to [Ontario Health atHome ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://ontariohealthathome.ca/home-care/) or Toronto Paramedic Services\u2019 Community Paramedics for follow-up.\n\nThe Community Paramedicine program also receives referrals directly from third party sources, including local hospitals, primary care, community agencies, allied emergency services, as well as clients and caregivers. Clients can be referred using the attached Referral Form, as well as by phone, email, or fax.\n\n## Community Paramedic Led Clinic\n\nCommunity Paramedic-Led Clinics (CPLC) are operated biweekly by Community Paramedics to support seniors and other at-risk demographics. These wellness clinics are typically located in Toronto Community Housing, Toronto Seniors Housing, and shelters where Community Paramedics (CPs) provide patient assessments, vital sign checks, health education and referrals to various community programs and services.\n\nThe CPLC team performs multiple functions and primarily serves frail, vulnerable, and (in some instances) homebound residents. Clients are supported by one-on-one clinic assessments, health and wellness educational presentations, and home visiting. Clients typically have their vital signs assessed (and monitored for trends), their health-related questions answered, and referrals made for additional services (where appropriate).\n\nAt clinic locations potential clients are identified through review of recent 911 calls placed at clinic locations to Paramedic Services. CPs can reach out to the 911 caller/potential client and invite them to the biweekly clinic. Alternatively, the CP may opt to follow up later, with the goal of better supporting the individual at home.\n\n## Community Paramedic Home Visit Program\n\nCommunity Paramedics perform home visits for clients who require additional support in the community. Clients are predominantly identified through three sources:\n\n1. Paramedic referrals from emergency calls (i.e. CREMS referrals),\n2. Analysis of frequent requests for Paramedic service via 911, and\n3. Direct referrals from program partners, clients, or caregivers.\n\nThe home visit program assists vulnerable clients in Toronto through:\n\n- Advanced medical assessment, vital signs evaluation, and diagnostics\n- Identifying and addressing gaps in healthcare and social support\n- Healthcare system navigation and connecting clients to additional community supports and services\n- Working with partner agencies and primary care to support and augment existing services and programs\n- Coaching and education on various topics, including chronic disease management\n- Support with hospital discharge planning and providing outreach to clients returning home from hospital\n- Collaboration of multi-agency support via situation tables (e.g., FOCUS) and patient care conferences\n- Vaccinations for homebound individuals\n- Follow-up with frequent users of 911 and the emergency departments they attend (where appropriate)\n\nThe program provides non-emergent home visits; typically referrals are responded to within one to three business days for booking of an initial home visit. If a more urgent visit is required, partners are encouraged to call 416-397-4322 and select option one to speak to the Community Paramedicine Program directly. For medical emergencies please call 9-1-1.\n\n## Targeted Street Outreach\n\nCommunity Paramedics participate in weekly targeted street outreach with the City of Toronto\u2019s Streets-to-Homes outreach workers to provide medical and social support to clients experiencing homelessness. City outreach workers identify individuals who would benefit from a Community Paramedic assessment, and the joint Community Paramedic-outreach worker team perform targeted visits. City-wide outreach typically occurs at locations such as encampments, shelters, or areas where clients are known to be located. The partnership provides opportunity to build and maintain positive relationships and connections between clients, Paramedics, and the healthcare system.\n\nAs an extension of Toronto Public Health\u2019s \u201c [The Works ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/health-wellness-care/health-programs-advice/services-provided-by-the-works/)\u201d program, Community Paramedics provide free Naloxone (also referred to as Narcan) kits and training to clients at risk of opioid overdose, as well their family and friends. Kits are available for distribution to eligible clients across the city to help address the increasing opioid overdose crisis.\n\n## Community Paramedicine Homebound Vaccination Program\n\nToronto Paramedic Services supports homebound clients and their caregivers with in-home Influenza and COVID-19 vaccinations. Clients are primarily referred by their assigned Care Coordinator at Home and Community Care Support Services (HCCSS). Alternatively, clients who do not receive HCCSS support can be also referred through by their primary care provider or the [Toronto Seniors Helpline ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://torontoseniorshelpline.ca/).\n\nHomebound clients are defined as those experiencing medical, physical, cognitive, or psychosocial needs/conditions that inhibit them from visiting a local clinic, pharmacy, or primary care provider. Additionally, transportation and other strategies to remedy access challenges are either not available or not appropriate given the circumstances.\n\nToronto Paramedic Services has staffed targeted vaccination clinics for vulnerable individuals since 2002. Targeted clinics occur in several congregate settings, including retirement homes, subsidized housing, shelter locations, encampment sites, as well as hotspots identified by Toronto Public Health. Vaccination clinics have typically provided seasonal influenza vaccination; however, the clinics\u2019 scope was expanded in 2020 to include COVID-19 vaccines during the pandemic.\n\n**Please note this program is seasonal and runs from October to March each year.**\n\n## Community Paramedicine for Long-Term Care\n\nThe Community Paramedicine for Long-Term Care (CPLTC) program focuses on supporting clients who are eligible for or awaiting placement within a long-term care home. Community Paramedics perform home visits and remote consultations with clients to identify and investigate gaps in services. The mandate of the program is to create or enhance the clients\u2019 connections and supports while they await long-term care placement. Home visits involve a physical assessment, medical and social history gathering, vital signs acquisition, and other diagnostics required to identify and execute treatment options for clients. In addition to scheduled visits, the program responds to real-time requests for in-home support from clients, their caregivers, and community practitioners.\n\n## Complex Care Cases Program\n\nThe Complex Care Cases (CCC) program is intended to identify clients (usually children) living in the community who have medically complex care requirements. The program addresses each clients\u2019 treatment needs and hospital destination considerations. Every client is issued a specialized treatment plan (also known as an Emergency Information Sheet) which provides guidance to family members, caregivers, and first responders in the event of a medical emergency requiring a 911 response. The CCC program is a collaborative effort between Community Paramedics, Emergency Medical Dispatchers and Call Takers, Toronto Paramedic Services\u2019 Medical Director, Sunnybrook Regional Base Hospital, Home Community Care Support Services (HCCSS), the Hospital for Sick Children, and the families/caregivers of the complex clients.\n\nReferrals are received directly from either the Hospital for Sick Children Complex Care team or through the HCCSS Care Coordinator. Each referral received is thoroughly reviewed and screened for eligibility.\n\nCCC eligibility criteria includes:\n\n- Lives within the City of Toronto (\u2018M\u2019 postal code)\n- Complex treatment requirements and/or equipment that provides treatment interventions outside of the Paramedic\u2019s standard scope of practice\n- A hospital requirement that differs from conventional hospital destination protocols\n\nFor more information about this program, or to discuss eligibility and enrollment, please contact [cphome@toronto.ca ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](mailto:cphome@toronto.ca) or 416-397-4322 and select option one.\n\n### Community Paramedicine Contact Information\n\nAll inquiries or referrals for the Toronto Paramedic Services Community Paramedicine Program can be directed to:\n\n- Email: [cphome@toronto.ca ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](mailto:cphome@toronto.ca)\n- Phone: 416-397-4322, (option 1)\n- Secure Fax: 416-696-3500\n\nAll inquiries or referrals for the Toronto Paramedic Services Homebound Vaccination Program can be directed to:\n\n- Email: [homevaccination@toronto.ca ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](mailto:homevaccination@toronto.ca)\n- Phone: 416-397-4322, (option 2)\n- Secure Fax: 416-696-3500\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=fv5i6m2bw2py)\n\nPCFET0NUWVBFIGh0bWw PGJvZHk 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",

TCHC [Community Safety Unit (CSU) ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](http://www.torontohousing.ca/current-tenants/tenant-safety/community-safety-unit) aims to foster community well-being and safety by building relationships with TCHC tenants, staff and community partners, delivering safety programs and enforcing various legislation as required to ensure the safety of all TCHC tenants and staff.\n\nIn 2021, the City of Toronto was [mandated ![PDF](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-pdf.svg)](https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2020/ex/bgrd/backgroundfile-157308.pdf \"PDF Document\") to conduct an independent review of the TCHC\u2019s Community Safety Unit. The City, in collaboration with TCHC, has been leading the CSU Review since the fall of 2023. A consultant, ConveneToronto, was hired\u00a0 to conduct the independent review.\n\nThe overall objective of the CSU Review is to produce an in-depth analysis of the CSU\u2019s operations, approaches and growth paths within the context of the City of Toronto\u2019s new and expanding commitments to community safety and well-being, as outlined in the City\u2019s [SafeTO:10-yr Community Safety and Well-Being Plan](http://www.toronto.ca/community-people/public-safety-alerts/community-safety-programs/community-safety-well-being-plan/). The final report will be submitted to Toronto City Council and TCHC\u2019s Board of Directors by the end of 2024.\n\nThe CSU Review, in focus and approach, aligns with the City\u2019s and TCHC\u2019s broader commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion. More specifically, it aligns with TCHC\u2019s Confronting Anti-Black Racism (CABR) strategy, as well as, reconciliation and confronting anti-Black racism, as expressed through the City\u2019s [Reconciliation Action Plan](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/accountability-operations-customer-service/long-term-vision-plans-and-strategies/reconciliation-action-plan/), [Toronto Action Plan to Confront Anti-Black Racism](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/get-involved/community/confronting-anti-black-racism/) and deliberate commitments to equity through policy frameworks that support equity-deserving and vulnerable populations.\n\n## CSU Black Employee Lifecycle Review\n\nTo further advance these commitments, the City of Toronto has integrated a Black Employee Lifecycle Review co-led by TCHC\u2019s Centre for Advancing the Interests of Black People into the broader CSU Review. The Black Employee Lifecycle Review will focus on the experiences of the unit\u2019s Black employees during the various stages of the employment lifecycle. The CSU Black Employee Lifecycle Review is being advanced through a shared leadership model between TCHC and the City of Toronto.\n\n## CSU Review Timeline\n\n### Complete:\u00a0Interviews and Focus Groups  January to August 2024 \u2013 Complete\n\nConveneToronto conducts. Work includes: focused interviews and focus group discussions with tenants and TCHC and City of Toronto staff and community partners.\n\n### Complete:\u00a0Black CSU Employee Review  July to August 2024 \u2013 Complete\n\nConveneToronto conducts Black Employee Lifecycle Review with Black CSU staff.\n\n### Complete:\u00a0Submit Final CSU Review Report  October 2024 \u2013 Complete\n\nConveneToronto submits the final CSU Review report to the City of Toronto for consideration.\n\n### Current:\u00a0Present Final CSU Review Report  Fall/Winter 2024 \u2013 Current\n\nCity of Toronto finalizes and presents the final CSU Review report to the TCHC Board of Directors.\n\nThroughout the CSU Review process, the City of Toronto will provide regular updates to the Toronto Community Housing Corporation Board and subcommittees, including the Community Safety Advisory Committee.\n\nFor more details, or if you have questions about the City\u2019s role in the TCHC Community Safety Unit Review, please contact: Imara Rolston, CSU Review Project Manager, at [imara.rolston@toronto.ca](mailto:imara.rolston@toronto.ca).\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=snhxyjp39o1c)\n\nPCFET0NUWVBFIGh0bWw PGJvZHk 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",

        "markdown": "![City of Toronto](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/themes/cot/img/logo-print.svg)\n\n# Open Air Burning\n\nOpen air burning includes bonfires, fire pits, sky lanterns and the use of various types of outdoor fireplaces (also known as a \u201cChiminea\u201d). Although outdoor fireplaces can be purchased at retail outlets throughout the city, it does not mean open air burning is permitted for their use.\n\nOpen air burning is not permitted. Exceptions to open air burning require a permit and are found below under the tab Open Air Burn Permit and Cultural Fire Authorization.\n\nExpand All Open Air Burning accordion panelsCollapse All Open Air Burning accordion panels\n\n## Ontario Fire Code 2.4.4.4.\n\n(1) Open-air burning shall not take place unless\n\n(a) it has been approved, or\n\n(b) the open-air burning consists of a small, confined fire that is\n\n(i) used to cook food on a grill, barbecue or spit,\n\n(ii) commensurate with the type and quantity of food being cooked, and\n\n(iii) supervised at all times.\n\n(2) Sentence (1) does not apply to the use of an appliance that\n\n(a) meets the requirements of the Technical Standards and Safety Act, 2000,\n\n(b) is for outdoor use,\n\n(c) if assembled, has been assembled in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, and\n\n(d) if installed, has been installed in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\nAt no time is it permissible to burn leaves, rubbish or anything else that is not related to cooking as described above. Any open air burning that does not meet the above requirements in the Ontario Fire Code shall be extinguished.\n\n## Open Air Burn Permit & Cultural Fire Authorization\n\nThere are some rare occasions where open-air burns are approved, examples of these would include:\n\n- Those conducted in designated areas within City Parks where an Event Letter permitting the burn is obtained from [Parks, Forestry & Recreation](https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/venues-facilities-bookings/booking-park-recreation-facilities/special-events-permit-booking/).\n- Those conducted on private property for example, fire extinguisher training. Prior to issuance of an Open Air Burn Permit, Toronto Fire Services will conduct a site inspection.\n- Gas Fire Pits (Campfire Effect Units) are designed to operate with propane or natural gas. They are intended for outdoor use only, not for food preparation. In Toronto, patio campfire units that are ULC and CSA approved are deemed \u201capproved\u201d under the Fire Code provided they are supervised at all times, and operated in accordance with manufacturer\u2019s instructions in a safe manner and the location is away from combustibles.\n\nNote: Solid fuel burning appliances are unacceptable.\n\n**Requirements for Open Air Burn Permit and Cultural Fire Authorization**. **Prior to issuance of permits, Toronto Fire Services will conduct a site inspection**.\n\n**Open Air Burn Permits:**\n\nOpen Air Burn Permit is required for approval for purposes of compliance with Article 2.4.4.4 of the Ontario Fire Code granted by the Fire Department for all other purposes other than specific cultural or religious practices, ceremonies, or events; including, but not limited to, film shoots, private events not associated with a specific cultural or religious practice, ceremony, or event, or general fire pits;\n\nUnder Chapter 441, open Air Burn Permits for Private commercial events will be charged $284.83 effective April 1 2023.\n\n**Cultural Fire Authorization Permits:**\n\nApproval for purposes of compliance with Article 2.4.4.4 of the Ontario Fire Code granted by the Fire Department with respect to open air burning conducted as a cultural fire. A cultural fire is an open air burn conducted in connection with a specific cultural or religious practice, ceremony, or event;\n\nUnder Chapter 441 Cultural Fire Authorization would not be charged a user fee to the applicant seeking to oversee open-air burning as part of a cultural or religious practice, ceremony, or event.\n\n**Permits:**\n\nIf your web browser has issues with the \u201cOpen Air

The two major barriers to performing CPR and using an AED are lack of sufficient training, and fear of doing something wrong. You cannot hurt someone who has suffered a sudden cardiac arrest, you can only help.The Chase Mceachern Act and the Good Samaritan Act protect you from liability in the duties of providing CPR and using an AED.\n\n### If You Witness a Sudden Cardiac Arrest:\n\n- Call **9\u20111\u20111** for the paramedics.\n- Start CPR: Push hard and fast on the person\u2019s chest 100\u2013120 times per minute.\n- Send someone for the AED (automatic external defibrillator). These are located at most entrances of buildings. The Emergency Medical Dispatch can tell you where the closest one is located and is trained to guide you to perform CPR and use the AED\n- When the AED arrives, open up the lid and follow the voice prompts.\n\n### How to Take a Course:\n\n[Providers Approved to Deliver Emergency and Standard First Aid ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://www.wsib.ca/en/providers-approved-deliver-emergency-and-standard-first-aid)\n\nUpon successful course completion, each participant will receive official certification cards for the course(s) completed.\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=w4g1be3pg5ff)\n\nPCFET0NUWVBFIGh0bWw PGJvZHk 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",

Stand up and move around to allow circulation to reach better reach all body parts.\n\n### Blankets and portable seat/cushion\n\nSitting on cold pavement or concrete can increase the risk of hypothermia. Sitting on a blanket or portable seat will limit the risk.\n\n### Drink fluids\n\nDehydration can occur even when the temperature is below freezing. Hot chocolate is a great way to remain well hydrated.\n\n### Avoid alcoholic beverages\n\nAlcohol diminishes the body\u2019s ability to feel the cold and can cause an increased exposure time.\n\n### Signs of hypothermia\n\nConfusion, lethargy, weakness, apathy, pale skin colour.\n\n### Signs of frostbite\n\nPale grey, waxy textured skin in affected area cold to the touch, numbness and localized pain, swelling and blistering.\n\n## Generators\n\nConsumers must know that portable generators can be hazardous if used improperly. The hazards are:\n\n- Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning from the toxic engine exhaust and\n- Electrocution from connecting the generator to the home electrical wiring system.\n\n### To avoid carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning:\n\n- Never use a generator indoors or in attached garages.\n- Only operate the generator outdoors in a well-ventilated, dry area, away from air intakes to the home, and protected from direct exposure to rain and snow, preferably under a canopy, open shed, or carport.\n\n### To avoid electrocution:\n\n- Plug individual appliances into the generator using heavy duty, outdoor rated cords with a wire gauge adequate for the appliance load.\n- Observe the generator manufacturer\u2019s instructions for safe operation.\n- Do not plug the generator into a wall outlet.\n- If connecting the generator into the house wiring is necessary, have a qualified electrician hook up the standby electrical system, or have the local utility install a linking device if available.\n\nNever store gasoline in the home. Gasoline, kerosene and other flammable liquids should be stored outside of living areas in properly labeled, non-glass safety containers. They should also not be stored in a garage if a fuel-burning appliance is in the garage. The vapor from gasoline can travel invisibly along the ground and be ignited by pilot lights or arcs caused by activating electric switches.\n\nIf at all possible, avoid connecting the electrical output of the generator into the house wiring. Instead, connect individual appliances that have their own outdoor rated power cord directly to the receptacle outlet of the generator, or connect these cord-connected appliances to the generator\u2019s electrical outlet via a suitable, outdoor-rated extension cord having a sufficient wire gauge to handle the electrical load.\n\nIf connecting into the house wiring is necessary on a temporary basis to operate permanently wired equipment, such as a water pump, furnace blower/controls, room lighting, etc., there are important steps that require the utmost care to avoid electrocution. In some locations, the local utility company may offer to install a device at the electric meter socket to permit their customers to connect a portable generator to the household wiring during periods of power outages. If that service is not available or chosen, another method is to have a qualified electrician install a manual transfer switch.\n\nA transfer switch permits transfer of the load from the household power source that is normally supplied by the electric utility over to the portable generator. The transfer switch should be certified by UL, CSA, or other independent test lab for this application, and be mounted within an electrical box. Transfer switches and related accessories designed for connecting a standby system are available from electrical supply stores. The equipment for these accessories includes:\n\n- cord sets with special locking and recessed connectors\n- electrical boxes with controls for the branch circuits that will receive temporary power from the generator\n- feeder cable to connect the existing electrical panel to the transfer switch\n\nWhen properly installed, the transfer switch will isolate the circuits supplied by the generator from those normally supplied by the utility. This prevents inadvertently energizing circuits in both systems, and reduces the possibility of electrocution resulting from contact with conductors presumed to be de-energized.\n\nDo not operate more appliances and equipment than the output rating of the generator.\n\n## Space Heaters\n\n- Keep portable and space heaters at least one metre (three feet) away from anything combustible including paper, drapes, loose clothes furniture, bedding and wallpaper.\n- Never place clothes on a heater to dry.\n- Avoid leaving heaters on when you leave the house or go to bed.\n- Keep children well away from heaters.\n\nSpace heaters must have a Canadian Standards Association (CSA) label.\n\n## Fireplaces\n\n- Have a professional inspect and clean your chimney at least once a year.\n- Always use a fire screen.\n- Burn only materials appropriate for a fireplace.\n- Never burn trash or paper \u2013 burning paper can fly out your chimney.\n- Put ashes in metal containers and never store them in your home.\n\n## Be Cautious of Ice when Walking & Driving\n\n- Be nice, clear your ice. This not only helps pedestrians but also the emergency workers that may be responding to your home or work site.\n- Have a safety kit in your car. A first aid kit, booster cables, gloves and hats, non perishable snacks, blanket, and candles would be a great start to protecting yourself while travelling.\n- When driving on snowy or icy roads, keep in mind that it takes longer for vehicles to stop. Reduce your speed on slippery roads and give yourself plenty of room to stop.\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=f2sw0lv1dxe5)",

Protect your family and home from fire with smoke alarms and by planning your escape.\n\nChildren are one of the most at risk groups for injury or death in a fire. Parents and caregivers, [see what services Toronto Fire offers to your children\u2019s schools.](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/public-safety-alerts/understanding-emergency-services/fire-safety-information-presentations-and-event-booths/)\n\nInstall Smoke Alarms\n\n\nInstalling smoke alarms in your home provides valuable time for you and your family to escape when fire strikes. This early warning is critical because the majority of fatal home fires occur at night while people are sleeping. Place smoke alarms at the top of stairways leading to bedrooms and at the top of stairs leading from the basement. Every home must have at least one smoke alarm for each floor where there are sleeping areas and ideally one should be installed in each bedroom. Test your smoke alarms weekly and immediately replace batteries when needed. Carefully follow the manufacturer\u2019s installation and maintenance instructions. Smoke alarms are simple to install and save lives. For more information, visit our Smoke Alarms page.\n\nPlan to Escape\n\n\nDraw a floor plan of your home showing all possible exits from each room. Plan a main escape route and an alternate escape route from each room, especially bedrooms. When fire strikes, a planned step-by-step escape route can reduce panic and confusion. Most of all, it can save lives.\n\n#### Choose a meeting place\n\nArrange an outside meeting place and a safe location to call 9-1-1. The best place to meet is in front of your home, where firefighters will arrive.\n\n#### Practice your plan\n\nConduct a fire drill at least once every six months. The best place to start your fire drill is from a bedroom. Sound the alarm and get everyone in the home to participate. In a real fire, you must be prepared to move quickly and carefully without confusion. Don\u2019t rush through the drill. Make sure everyone knows exactly what to do. After the drill, discuss what took place and how to improve performance.\n\nMake your fire drill as realistic as possible. Practice two escape routes. Vary your drills. For example, one drill might place a fire in an attic while another might place it in a kitchen. Make sure everyone understands how escape routes are altered depending on different fire locations. Pretend that there are no lights, and that your escape routes are filling with smoke.\n\nEscape\n\n\n#### Crawl low under smoke\n\nHeat and smoke rise so the air by the floor is the coolest and clearest. If you encounter smoke or flames while evacuating, stay close to the floor. Get down on your hands and knees and crawl to the nearest safe exit.\n\n#### Test every door\n\nBefore opening any door, make sure it is safe to do so. Reach up with the back of your hand to touch the door, the door handle, and the space between the door and frame. If any of them feel hot, use your alternate exit. If everything feels cool, brace your shoulder against the door and open it carefully. Be ready to close it quickly if heat or smoke rush in. As you leave, close all doors behind you. Closed doors restrain the deadly speed of smoke and fire!\n\n#### If you are trapped\n\nClose doors between you and the fire. Use blankets or towels to cover vents and cracks between floors and doors. Wait at a window and signal for help by using a flashlight or by waving a bright coloured sheet or cloth. If there is a phone in the room, call 9-1-1, and tell them exactly where you are.\n\n#### In an apartment\n\nIt is important that everyone be able to unlock all locks quickly. Use stairways to leave the building. Don\u2019t use an elevator. The heat may activate call buttons and carry you to a fire floor. The elevator may also lose power.\n\n#### In a two-storey house\n\nMake sure everyone can unlock all locks and open all windows and doors quickly. Know how to escape safely from the second floor. Make appropriate arrangements for small children and people with special needs.\n\n#### Get out fast\n\nMake sure your family knows to leave immediately when they hear a smoke alarm or someone yelling, \u201cFire!\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t try to take possessions or pets. After you are out, call 9-1-1.\n\n#### Don\u2019t go back, no matter what\n\nOnce outside and at the designated meeting place, no one re-enters the burning house. Firefighters are equipped and trained to handle rescue operations and they will let you know when it is safe to go back into the house. Get out and stay out!\n\nVideo Player\n\n[https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/90fb-Every-second-counts-in-a-home-fire.mp4](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/90fb-Every-second-counts-in-a-home-fire.mp4)\n\nMedia error: Format(s) not supported or source(s) not found\n\n[Download File: https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/90fb-Every-second-counts-in-a-home-fire.mp4?\\_=1](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/90fb-Every-second-counts-in-a-home-fire.mp4?_=1)\n\n00:00\n\n00:00\n\n00:00\n\n[Use Up/Down Arrow keys to increase or decrease volume.](javascript:void(0);)\n\n[\u201cAlarmed for Life\u201d \u2013 Your Home Safety Kit ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/98c9-get-out-alive-planning-kit.pdf \"PDF Document\")\n\n[\u201cAlarmed for Life\u201d \u2013 Your Home Safety Kit in multiple languages](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/public-safety-alerts/safety-tips-prevention/posters-pamphlets-and-other-safety-resources/)\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=bk9h3g447yvq)\n\nPCFET0NUWVBFIGh0bWw PGJvZHk 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",

Each year numerous fires in the workplace cause injury and property loss.\n\nIf a fire started in your office or in the building where you work, would you know what to do? Do you know your workplace evacuation procedures in the event of an alarm? What can you do to prevent fires in your workplace?\n\nKnowing the answers to these questions and following a few simple fire safety procedures can prevent tragic and wasteful fire loss in your workplace.\n\n[Public outreach Toronto Emergency Services can provide for your workplace](https://www.toronto.ca/?page_id=22307)\n\nBe Prepared\n\n\nThese procedures are based on your workplace having a fire alarm system and an approved fire safety plan. Your building may not have an alarm system or a detailed fire safety plan. Your workplace fire evacuation procedures may differ. Make it your business to know the fire safety plan and evacuation procedures in your workplace.\n\n#### Employees should know\n\n- the location of two exits closest to their work area;\n- the location of the nearest fire alarm pull station and how to use it;\n- the phone number for The Toronto Fire Services (9-1-1);\n- your responsibilities in a fire, which are in the fire safety plan;\n\n\nthe fire emergency procedures posted on your floor.\n- if you work in a high building, visit the Fire in the Sky \u2013 Fire safety in high buildings page for more information.\n\n#### Employers are responsible for\n\n- preparing and implementing the Fire Safety Plan;\n- informing employees of the Fire Safety Plan;\n- posting fire emergency procedures on each floor;\n- conducting regular fire drills with all employees.\n\nIf You Discover a Fire\n\n\n- Activate the nearest fire alarm pull station on the fire floor.\n- Leave the area immediately, closing all doors behind you.\n- Take keys with you.\n- Go to the nearest exit and leave the building. Close all doors behind you.\n- If you encounter smoke, consider taking an alternate stairwell/exit. Heat and smoke rise leaving cleaner air near the floor. Crawl low under smoke.\n- Call the Toronto Fire Services at 9-1-1 regardless of the size of the fire. Never assume this has been done.\n\n\nGive correct address, location of fire and your name.\n\nMost workplaces contain portable fire extinguishers. Fire extinguishers can only put out small, contained fires, such as a fire in a wastebasket. The extinguisher in your workplace may or may not be suitable for dealing with grease or electrical fires.\n\nIf you have not been trained in the proper use of portable extinguishers, do not attempt to fight a fire.\n\n**Even with proper fire extinguisher training never fight a fire:**\n\n- if the fire is large or spreading.\n- if your escape route may be blocked by the spread of fire.\n- \u00a0if you are not trained in the correct use of the type of extinguisher or are unsure of the type of fire.\n\n**If you have fire extinguisher training and do choose to fight a fire:**\n\n\u2022 call the Toronto Fire Services first at 9-1-1\n\n\u2022 ensure everyone has evacuated or is leaving the area/building.\n\n\u2022 only fight a small fire.\n\nFor more information on portable fire extinguishers and their use, visit our fire extinguishers page under [Fire Safety Equipment](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/public-safety-alerts/safety-tips-prevention/safety-equipment-devices/).\n\nFire Prevention Tips for a Safer Workplace\n\n\n#### Smoking\n\n- Smoke only in areas allowed.\n- Use large, non-tip ashtrays. Do not empty contents into wastebaskets.\n- Check for smoldering cigarettes on furniture and in wastebaskets.\n\n#### Wiring\n\n- Check and replace any electrical cords that have cracked insulation or broken connectors.\n- Avoid octopus wiring.\n\n\nDo not run extension cords across doorways or under rugs.\n- Avoid plugging more than one extension cord into an outlet.\n- Use only CSA (Canadian Standards Association) approved power bars.\n\n#### Appliances\n\n- Use only CSA approved appliances.\n- Leave enough space for the circulation of air around heaters and other equipment such as computer terminals and copy machines.\n- Keep all appliances a safe distance from combustible materials.\n- Always turn off or unplug appliances at the end of each day.\n\nArson\n\n\nArson is one of the leading causes of fire in the workplace. To prevent or minimize the risk of fire due to arson, remember:\n\n- to be aware of your building security procedures;\n- report any type of vandalism and notify security and/or police of suspicious behavior and visitors;\n- lock doors after working hours;\n- ensure areas around your building are free of combustibles and are well lit;\n- keep all halls, lobbies and areas used by the public clear of obstructions.\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=pjj4s6vbu05i)\n\nPCFET0NUWVBFIGh0bWw PGJvZHk 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",

        "markdown": "![City of Toronto](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/themes/cot/img/logo-print.svg)\n\n# High-Rise Fire Safety\n\nThe following information is a general guide for high-rise buildings. Since each building is unique, you should learn the approved \u201cFire Safety Plan\u201d specifically designed for your building.\n\n[Owners: What services can Toronto Emergency Services provide for your building](https://www.toronto.ca/?page_id=22307)\n\nWhat Is A High-Rise Building?\n\n\nThe Ontario Building Code defines Residential \u201chigh-rise buildings\u201d as those being seven storeys or more in height or more specifically the floor level of the highest storey of that major occupancy is more than 18 m above grade.\n\nHigh-Rise Buildings Are Designed To Be Safe\n\n\n- High-rise buildings are designed to be more fire-safe than an average single-family dwelling. Floors and ceilings are constructed with fire-resistant materials and are separated into fire compartments. The compartments act as barriers to resist fire from spreading. Floors, walls, and ceilings provide a barrier against the spread of fire, and suite doors must close automatically to protect openings.\n- High-rise buildings have interior fire-separated stairwell shafts. Signs should be posted within stairwells indicating which floor level you are on, and also identify the nearest crossover floors, if certain floors are not accessible. Keep stairwell doors closed at all times to preserve the safety of these escape stairs. Every floor has access to at least 2 separate exit stairways which provide a protected path to the exterior.\n- High-rise buildings contain a fire alarm system designed to alert occupants when activated. Types of fire alarm devices include smoke detectors, thermal detectors and sprinkler flow switches. A fire alarm system provides early warning to occupants of a fire condition.\n- Modern High-rise buildings often have a voice communication system, used by supervisory personnel to make announcements about fire location and conditions.\n- Some High-rise buildings have sprinkler systems to put water directly on the source of the fire. High-rise buildings also contain a standpipe system, that is an interior water supply system of fire hose cabinets on each floor for use by firefighters. Most buildings also have portable fire extinguishers in these cabinets.\n\nFire Safety Begins With You\n\n\nLearn what to do if a fire happens in your building. This is the best way to protect yourself and those around you.\n\n- Talk to your landlord, superintendent or building manager.\n- Know the emergency procedures outlined in the building\u2019s fire safety plan.\n- Create a home escape plan and practice it with everyone in your home.\n- Every fire is different. You must act quickly when you hear the alarm or discover a fire.\n- Remember, most people die from the smoke, not the fire.\n\nHigh-rise buildings are designed to be fire-safe. But, because they may contain many people, and because of the building\u2019s tremendous size, emergency response is challenging with significant potential for major incidents.\n\nDue to equipment limitations, firefighters cannot rescue people from an outside balcony or window above the seventh floor. Also, a rooftop helicopter rescue is too dangerous. Firefighters must do interior firefighting and rescue tactics.\n\nIf There Is A Fire In Your Suite\n\n\nIf there is a fire in your suite, it is not safe to stay inside! Stay away from poisonous smoke!\n\n- Everyone evacuate immediately.\n- Close, but don\u2019t lock, all doors behind you.\n- Pull the red fire alarm pull station next to the stairwell on your floor and yell \u201cfire\u201d.\n- Leave the building using the nearest exit stairway.\n- Do not use the elevator.\n- Never go to the roof, smoke rises! Doors to the roof are locked and you could become trapped.\n- Call the fire department at 9-1-1 from a safe location. (Never assume this has been done).\n- Meet the firefighters when they arrive and tell them where the fire is.\n- Once out, stay out.\n- Do not go back into the building until the fire department tells you it\u2019s safe.\n\nWhen You Hear The Building Fire Alarm\n\n\nStay in your suite (if safe to do so) until you are rescued or until you are told to leave.\n\n1. If the fire is NOT in your suite, you are typically safe to remain there. Your suite walls, floors, and ceilings are composed of non-combustible construction and will protect you from smoke and fire.\n2. Keep smoke from entering your suite. Use duct tape to seal cracks around the door and place wet towels at the bottom. Seal vents or air ducts the same way. See a recommended \u201cHigh-Rise Survival Kit\u201d below.\n\nIf smoke does start to enter your suite (and you are unable to evacuate).\n\n1. Call the fire department at 9-1-1 and tell them where you are and then move to the balcony. Close the doors behind you.\n2. If you don\u2019t have a balcony, go to the most smoke-free room, close the door and seal it with wide tape and towels. If necessary, open the window for fresh air. Show emergency personnel where you are by hanging a\n\n\nsheet from the window or balcony.\n3. Keep low to the floor where the air is cleaner.\n4. Listen for instructions from authorities.\n\nHigh-Rise Survival Kit\n\n\nThe Toronto Fire Services recommends a high-rise survival kit for tenants of high buildings, readily available if they become trapped during a fire. You can purchase the following list of items for less than $50. Having these items available for emergency use may improve your chances of surviving a fire.\n\n- **Wet towel** \u2013 Place at the base of a door.\n- **Duct tape** \u2013 Tape over door and vent openings.\n- **Foil wrap** \u2013 Use to cover vent openings.\n- **Whistle** \u2013 Use to signal for help.\n- **Flashlight** \u2013 Use in case of power failure, smoke, or to signal for help.\n- **Bright-coloured cloth** \u2013 Hang up in a window, or on a balcony, to identify your location.\n- **Ink marker** \u2013 Use for messages on cloth, door or windows.\n- **Cotton bedsheet** \u2013 If smoke is heavy in your room, soak the bed sheet with water and make a tent near an open window.\n- **Washcloth** \u2013 Place the wet cloth over your mouth and nose to aid breathing in smoke-filled areas.\n- **Fire safety plan** \u2013 Have a copy of your building\u2019s emergency procedures available.\n- **Plastic pail with lid** \u2013 Use for storing survival equipment.

Statistics demonstrate that there has never been a multiple loss of life in a fully sprinklered building where the system operated as designed. Sprinklers are a cost-effective technology that provides for a high level of life safety. Residential fire sprinkler technology is proving both reliable and effective. Property losses are 85% less in residences with fire sprinklers compared to those without. As positive as this information is however, there are still common misunderstandings about the operation and effectiveness of home fire sprinkler systems. The following are some of the more common myths:\n\nMyth 1: \"Water damage from a sprinkler system will be more extensive than fire damage\"\n\n\n**Fact:** Water damage from a home sprinkler system will be much less severe than the damage caused by water from fire-fighting hose lines or smoke and fire damage if the fire goes unabated. Quick response sprinklers release approximately 30-90 litres (8-24 gallons) of water per minute compared to 190-473 litres (50-125 gallons) per minute released by a fire hose.\n\nMyth 2: \"When a fire activates one sprinkler head, all sprinkler heads will activate\"\n\n\n**Fact:** Residential sprinklers respond independently to a rated temperature setting of approximately 74 degrees Celsius (165 degrees Fahrenheit). Usually, only one sprinkler is activated to extinguish or limit the fire to its room of origin.\n\nMyth 3: \"Sprinklers might activate by accident\"\n\n\n**Fact:** The odds of accidental discharge due to a manufacturing defect are 1 in 16 million per year.\n\nMyth 4: \"A sprinkler system might freeze in winter and cause water damage\"\n\n\n**Fact:** Much like your plumbing system, your sprinkler system piping is installed on inside walls adjacent to the ceiling framing and then insulated to entrap the available heat lost from the living area below.\n\nMyth 5: \"A smoke alarm on its own offers adequate protection\"\n\n\n**Fact:** Smoke alarms will save lives by providing a much-needed early warning system. However, smoke alarms do nothing to extinguish a growing fire. Too often, battery operated smoke alarms fail to function because of dead or missing batteries. In order for smoke alarms to be effective in saving lives, they must be working and they must be maintained on a regular basis.\n\nMyth 6: \"I can't afford a sprinkler system\"\n\n\n**Fact:** This is generally a statement of priority. We rarely hesitate when buying a more comfortable couch, plusher carpet, the latest stereo equipment or an upgraded computer. A sprinkler system can be installed in a new home for as little as $1.50 per square foot which, in many cases, would represent less than 2% of the total construction cost. System installation in existing homes is simple but more expensive.\n\nMyth 7: \"Sprinkler Systems are unattractive\"\n\n\n**Fact:** Fire damage is unattractive. Quick response residential sprinkler systems are designed to save your life by providing attractive ceiling and side mount sprinkler heads that blend unobtrusively into your room decor. Sprinklers, cover plates, and escutcheons can be custom painted by the manufacturer to match any decor.\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=8xzvjifngzax)\n\nPCFET0NUWVBFIGh0bWw PGJvZHk 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",

We want to make sure everyone is safe from CO. Install CO alarms, and do everything you can to prevent CO in your home in the first place. Beat the silent killer: Prevent Carbon Monoxide (CO) in your home.\n\nLandlord/Tenant Responsibilities\n\n\nLandlords must:\n\n- Install carbon monoxide alarms in accordance with the Ontario Fire Code\n- Maintain carbon monoxide alarms in operating condition\n- Maintain primary and secondary power supplies that serve carbon monoxide alarms\n- Provide the tenant a copy of the manufacturer\u2019s maintenance instructions\n- The same is true for [smoke alarms](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/public-safety-alerts/safety-tips-prevention/safety-equipment-devices/smoke-alarms/)\n\nTenants must:\n\n- Not disable the carbon monoxide alarm\n- Notify the landlord as soon as you are aware the carbon monoxide alarm in the unit is disconnected, not operating or the operation is impaired\n- The same is true for [smoke alarms](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/public-safety-alerts/safety-tips-prevention/safety-equipment-devices/smoke-alarms/)\n\nWhat do tenants do if the landlord does not provide working carbon monoxide alarms as required?\n\n- Call 311 for a referral to Toronto Fire Services and a Fire Inspector will attend\n\nThe penalties for violating these requirements under the\u00a0_Fire Protection and Prevention Act (FPPA)_\u00a0are:\n\n- $50,000 and/or 1 year in jail for an individual\n- $100,000 for a corporation\n\nCarbon Monoxide Alarms in Your House\n\n\nIf your home has a fuel-burning appliance, a fireplace or an attached garage, you must have a working CO alarm adjacent to each sleeping area of the home. For added protection, install a carbon monoxide alarm on every storey of the home according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Fuel-burning appliances can include furnaces, hot water heaters, gas or wood fireplaces, portable fuel-burning heaters and generators, barbeques, stoves and vehicles.\n\nCarbon Monoxide Alarms in Your Condo or Apartment\n\n\nThe Ontario Fire Code requires that in condo and apartment buildings with a service room, CO alarms must be installed in the service room and adjacent to each sleeping area of all homes above, below and beside the service room. In condo or apartment buildings that have a garage, CO alarms must be installed adjacent to each sleeping area of all homes above, below and beside the garage.\n\nWhat is Carbon Monoxide?\n\n\n- CO is known as the silent killer because it is an invisible, tasteless and odourless gas that can be deadly.\n- CO is produced when fuels such as propane, gasoline, natural gas, heating oil or wood do not burn completely in fuel-burning appliances and devices such as furnaces, gas or wood fireplaces, hot water heaters, stoves, barbeques, portable fuel-burning heaters and generators and vehicles.\n\nPrevent Carbon Monoxide in Your Home\n\n\nEnsure all fuel-burning appliances in your home are inspected annually. Visit [COSafety.ca ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](http://cosafety.ca/) to find a registered contractor near you.\n\n- Check that all outside appliance vents are not blocked.\n- Never use a portable fuel-burning appliance inside (i.e. barbeques, portable heaters and generators).\n\nKnow the Symptoms of Carbon Monoxide Poisoning\n\n\n- Exposure to CO can cause flu-like symptoms such as headaches, nausea, dizziness, as well as confusion, drowsiness, loss of consciousness and death.\n- If your CO alarm sounds, and you or other occupants suffer from symptoms of CO poisoning, get everyone out of the home immediately. Then call 9-1-1 or your local emergency services number from outside the building.\n- If your CO alarm sounds, and no one is suffering from symptoms of CO poisoning, check to see if the battery needs replacing, or the alarm has reached its \u201cend-of-life\u201d before calling 9-1-1.\n\nKnow the Sound of Your Carbon Monoxide Alarm\n\n\n- Your CO alarm sounds different than your smoke alarm. Test both alarms monthly and make sure everyone in your home knows the difference between the two alarm sounds.\n- Don\u2019t be confused by the sound of your CO alarm\u2019s low-battery warning. Follow your CO alarm manufacturer\u2019s instructions so you know the difference between the low-battery warning, the \u201cend-of-life\u201d warning, and the alarm alerting you to the presence of CO in your home.\n\n[Carbon Monoxide Safety Infographic ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/9794-CO-Safety-Infographic-card.pdf \"PDF Document\")\n\n[Carbon Monoxide Safety for Houses Infographic ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/9743-CO-Safety-House-Safety-Infograph-Ontario-Fire-Marshal.pdf \"PDF Document\")\n\n[Carbon Monoxide Safety for Apartments and Condos Infographic ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/97a4-CO-Safety-Apartment-Condo.pdf \"PDF Document\")\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=b3sw9vrusenh)",

It is essential for caregivers and students to talk about fire and life safety. Whether returning to school or leaving home for the first time, a discussion about good fire safety practices can help to ensure this exciting time in a students life is not marred by a fire tragedy.\n\nExpand All Student Accommodations Fire Safety accordion panelsCollapse All Student Accommodations Fire Safety accordion panels\n\n## Living Safely 101 - What Every Student Should Know to Prevent Fire\n\n#### Look While You Cook\n\nStay in the kitchen when cooking \u2013 especially if using oil or high temperatures. If a pot catches fire, have a proper-fitting pot lid handy to slide over the pot and turn off the stove. Cooking requires constant attention. Distractions like televisions, cell phones, or computers can lead to a tragic cooking fire.\n\n#### Candle With Care\n\nIf you use candles in your room or apartment, keep them away from anything that can burn and place them in a safe, sturdy holder with a glass shade or hurricane chimney. Place them where they cannot be knocked over and blow them out when leaving the room.\n\n#### Keep An Eye On Excessive Drinkers\n\nAlcohol is a common factor in many fire fatalities involving cooking and smoking. Be aware of roommates and friends who have been drinking excessively, especially if they are cooking or smoking.\n\n#### Smoke Outside\n\nEstablish rules for smokers. If you permit smoking inside, use large, sturdy ashtrays that can\u2019t be easily tipped over. Ashtrays should be emptied into a metal container not the garbage can. Check around furniture cushions after people have been smoking, especially if they have been drinking.\n\n#### Use Electricity Wisely\n\nToasters, coffeemakers and microwaves should be plugged directly into an outlet. If you must use an extension cord, buy one that is the correct gauge for the appliance and has a CSA or ULC approval mark on the label. CSA or ULC approved power bars may be used for stereo equipment, computers and lights.\n\n#### Clear the Clutter\n\nKeep things that burn away from heat sources like stovetops, space heaters and electronic equipment. Tea towels and paper too close to burners can catch fire. Keep space heaters at least one metre away from bedding, furniture and curtains.\n\n#### Working Smoke Alarms\n\nIt\u2019s the Law: Your room or apartment must have working smoke alarms. Test them monthly and notify the landlord immediately if they\u2019re not working. Dead batteries must be replaced right away. Nuisance alarms can be avoided by making sure smoke alarms are not located too close to the kitchen or bathroom. Consider getting a smoke alarm with a hush feature. Smoke alarms should be checked after any extended absence such as Christmas break and reading week. Never tamper with or disable a smoke alarm.\n\n#### Carbon Monoxide Alarms\n\nOntario law requires all homes/apartments to have a working carbon monoxide alarm outside all sleeping areas if there is a fuel-burning appliance or fireplace in the home/apartment. If the building has a service room or a garage, carbon monoxide alarms must be installed outside each sleeping area of all apartment units above, below and beside the service room or garage. If there is a service room, a carbon monoxide alarm also must be installed in the service room. Contact the local fire department for more information.\n\n#### Plan To Escape\n\nKnow two ways out of your room or apartment in case of fire. Identify all exits and make sure you can use them. If you live in a high-rise, familiarize yourself with the building\u2019s fire safety plan. If you discover fire, call the fire department from a safe location outside.\n\n#### Be Equipped\n\nTo stay safe, all students should put together a package that includes a smoke alarm and carbon monoxide alarm, a battery powered lantern or flashlight and radio, extra batteries and a CSA or ULC approved power bar.\n\n## A Parent\u2019s Guide to Finding Fire-safe Accommodation\n\n#### Smoke Alarms\n\nIt is the law in Ontario to have working smoke alarms on every storey and outside all sleeping areas. The law applies to single family, semi-detached, town homes and apartments (including basement apartments), whether owner-occupied or rented. Rooming houses have specific regulations about smoke alarms or fire alarm systems. In addition to smoke alarms within each unit or suite, apartment buildings and student residences operated by the school may also have a building fire alarm system. Make sure the landlord, administrator or superintendent identifies and explains the fire alarm and detection features in the building and unit.\n\n#### Carbon Monoxide Alarms\n\nOntario law requires all homes/apartments to have a working carbon monoxide alarm outside all sleeping areas if there is a fuel-burning appliance or fireplace in the home/apartment. If the building has a service room or a garage, carbon monoxide alarms must be installed outside each sleeping area of all apartment units above, below and beside the service room or garage. If there is a service room, a carbon monoxide alarm also must be installed in the service room. Contact the local fire department for more information.\n\n#### Fire Separations\n\nStudents often find accommodation in older homes that have been converted to apartments or rooming houses. At the time of the conversion, a building permit should have been obtained to ensure that fire safety features such as proper exits and fire separations between units are provided. Ask the owner if the property complies with the Building Code and Fire Code and to explain the fire safety features.\n\n#### Exits\n\nIt is important to consider how people will escape from a room or apartment in an emergency. Every room or apartment requires adequate exits that will permit unobstructed escape from the building. Make sure to ask the landlord or superintendent to identify all of the designated exits. All windows and doors should open fully and easily. Stairways and hallways must not be used for storage as this can pose serious fire safety hazards. Furniture and other obstacles can physically block exits and may fill hallways or stairways with smoke if they catch fire. This practice must be strictly avoided.\n\n#### Fire Escape Plans\n\nIn a fire emergency, everyone must know what to do and where to go. Large apartment buildings and student residence buildings require a fire safety plan, which informs the occupants about emergency procedures. Ask the building administrator or superintendent to explain the procedures in the fire safety plan.\n\nSmaller apartment buildings and houses that have been converted to apartments or lodging rooms may not have a fire safety plan, however its a good idea to ensure there are two ways out of the unit. The alternate way out can be a window that can be safely exited in an emergency.\n\n#### Security\n\nSome property owners install bars on windows as a security measure. While this may seem appealing from a security point of view, it can prevent students from escaping in an emergency situation. Security bars on windows should be equipped with a quick-opening device on the inside so the bars can be removed quickly.\n\n#### Electrical Safety\n\nMany buildings offering lodging to students are older homes that may not have upgraded wiring. Outlets in bathrooms or within one metre of the kitchen sink should be the Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI) type. Consider the number and location of electrical outlets in the room or apartment. There should be enough outlets so that appliances such as lamps, computer equipment and stereos can be operated without the use of extension cords. If extension cords cant be avoided, use multi-outlet power bars that are approved and provide surge protection and a circuit breaker. Make sure that electrical cords of any kind are not concealed under carpets or rugs where they can be easily damaged. Avoid overloaded circuits and octopus wiring.\n\n#### For more information\n\nContact the administration offices of the college or university. They will frequently maintain a registry of available accommodation for students. Call the local fire department to determine if the building has been inspected for Fire Code compliance.\n\n## Fire Safety Basics for Student Accommodation\n\n#### Cooking\n\nCooking is the number one cause of home fires in Ontario. If the student\u2019s accommodation has cooking facilities, there are some basic fire safety rules they must follow to prevent cooking fires:\n\n- A stovetop fire can start in a flash, so stay in the kitchen when something is cooking on the stove.\n- Keep all combustible items a safe distance away from the stove. This includes tea towels, wooden or plastic spoons and paper towels.\n- Keep a pot lid near the stove to smother flames if a fire starts in a pot.\n\n#### Candles\n\nThe use of candles is becoming more and more popular, especially among young people. To prevent candle fires:\n\n- Use tea lights or votive candles in non-combustible containers as they are generally a safer choice than tapers.\n- Place the candles in a location where they cant be knocked over or come in contact with combustible items.\n- Blow out all candles before leaving the room or going to bed.\n\n#### Space Heaters\n\nThe central heating systems in older accommodation is often supplemented with space heaters. To prevent heating fires:\n\n- Keep the space heater at least one metre away from anything that can burn, such as paper, bedding, furniture and curtains.\n- Turn off the space heater before going out or going to bed.\n\n#### Social Gatherings\n\nParties are as much a part of student life as attending classes. While most student parties are harmless fun, the consumption of alcohol combined with cooking or smoking can create a serious fire risk. To minimize the risk of fires during or after parties:\n\n- Avoid over-crowding. The more people attending the party, the easier it is to lose control of the situation.\n- Encourage guests to smoke outside. Consider putting up no smoking signs that direct guests to an outside smoking area.\n- Refrain from burning candles during parties. They can easily be knocked over or ignite nearby combustibles, unnoticed.\n\n#### Smoking\n\nFires caused by smoking can be deadly. Even if they don\u2019t smoke themselves, chances are the student will have friends that do. To prevent smoking fires:\n\n- Encourage smokers to go outside.\n- Keep large, deep ashtrays on hand that will reduce the risk of ashes and cigarette butts falling onto rugs or upholstery.\n- Allow ashes to cool completely before disposing.\n\n#### Electrical Equipment\n\nOverloaded circuits and octopus wiring are dangerous electrical hazards that can be avoided. To prevent fires caused by electrical equipment:\n\n- Use an approved power bar with a circuit breaker and surge protector to plug in computer and stereo equipment.\n- Avoid the use of extension cords as permanent wiring.\n- Make sure electrical cords are not concealed under carpets or rugs where they can be easily damaged.\n\n#### Smoke alarms\n\nIf a fire does occur, it is critical that the dwelling have working smoke alarms to alert occupants as soon as possible.\n\n- The responsibility for smoke alarm installation and maintenance lies with the homeowner or landlord, however it is a good idea for parents to provide their child with a smoke alarm for his or her bedroom.\n- It is against the law for tenants to disable or tamper with a smoke alarm.\n- If a smoke alarm activates due to steam from the shower or cooking on the stove, oven or toaster, ask the landlord to move the alarm to a different location, or to install a smoke alarm with a pause feature.\n\n#### Fire Escape Planning\n\nWhen the smoke alarm sounds, everyone must know what to do and where to go. Encourage\n\nstudents to develop a fire escape plan, keeping the following in mind:\n\n- Know two ways out of every room, if possible. The first way out would be the door, while the alternate escape could be a window that can be exited safely. Make sure all designated escape routes are accessible and free of clutter.\n- Leave the building as quickly as possible. Once outside, do not re-enter the building for any reason.\n- Call 9-1-1 from outside the building using a cell phone or neighbours phone.\n\n[Off Campus Housing Fire Safety Checklist \u2013 see it before you sign it ![PDF](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-pdf.svg)](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/91a6-Off-Campus-Housing-Fire-Safety-Checklist-see-it-before-you-sign-it.pdf \"PDF Document\")\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=1x8jn3t3y6ev)",

Just to make it easy, you should be answering yes to all of the following questions. If you answer no, have a closer look at the item to see if that is really how you wish to handle the situation.\n\nAt Home\n\n\n- Do you keep doors and windows locked at all times?\n- Do you have a peephole so that you can see who is outside without having to open the door?\n- Do you verify a person\u2019s identification before opening the door?\n- If a stranger asks to use your phone, do you refuse to let them into your home and offer to make the call yourself?\n- Do you, as a woman living alone, use your first initials only in telephone directories, on mailboxes, etc.?\n- Do you refuse to reveal personal information to anyone on the phone or at your door?\n- Do you always have your keys ready when approaching your home?\n- If you return home to find windows and doors tampered with, would you avoid entering and go to a neighbour\u2019s house to call the police?\n\nOn the Phone\n\n\n- Do you teach family members not to give personal or family information to strangers over the phone?\n- Do you instruct older children who are babysitting or the babysitter to always say that you are at home, but busy and so they will take a message?\n- Do you record only non-specific messages on your answering machine and avoid messages such as: \u201cWe\u2019ll be back around 7 o\u2019clock on Sunday\u201d?\n- Do you use the telephone company\u2019s \u2018Caller ID\u2019 feature?\n- If you receive an obscene or crank call, would you hang up immediately, saying nothing?\n\nOn the Go\n\n\n- Do you plan in advance the safest route to your destination?\n- Do you choose busy, well-lit streets?\n- Do you avoid routes that pass by high-risk areas?\n- Do you avoid isolated bus stops?\n- Do you walk facing traffic so you can see approaching cars?\n- Do you walk near the curb to avoid the element of surprise or someone hiding between shrubs or in a doorway?\n- Do you stay out of reach if someone in a vehicle asks directions?\n- Are you wary of approaching strangers?\n- If you continue to be followed, do you flee to the nearest safe place?\n- Do you try to get a description of the person and/or vehicle following you?\n- Do you avoid carrying large sums of money in your purse or wallet?\n- Do you carry your purse close to your body, without wrapping the straps around your arm or hand?\n- Do you avoid leaving a purse unattended, even for a moment?\n- Do you avoid displaying large amounts of cash in public?\n\nIn Your Car\n\n\n- Do you always lock your car doors while driving?\n- Do you keep windows rolled up whenever possible?\n- Do you avoid picking up hitchhikers?\n- Do you keep your car in good running order to avoid breakdowns in dangerous areas?\n- Do you look for well-lit areas to park your car?\n- Do you always lock your car when it is parked?\n- Do you look around the car before you get out, especially at night or in deserted areas such as underground parking lots?\n- When returning to your car, do you have your keys in hand?\n- Do you look in the back seat before getting into the car?\n- If you are being followed, do you avoid going home and go to the nearest place of safety instead?\n\nPlaces of Public Assembly\n\n\n#### Before you enter\n\n- Take a good look. Does the building you enter appear to be in a condition that makes you feel comfortable? Is the main entrance wide and does it open outward to allow easy exit? Is the outside area clear of materials stored against the building or blocking exits?\n- Have a communication plan. \u00a0Identify a relative or friend to contact in case of emergency and you are separated from family or friends.\n- Plan a meeting place. \u00a0Pick a meeting place outside to meet family or friends with whom you are attending the function. If there is an emergency, be sure to meet them there.\n\n#### When you enter\n\n- Take a good look. Locate exits immediately. When you enter a building you should look for all available exits. Some exits may be in front and some in back of you. Be prepared to use your closest exit. You may not be able to use the main exit.\n- Check for clear exit paths. \u00a0Make sure aisles are wide enough and not obstructed by chairs or furniture. Check to make sure your exit door is not blocked or chained. If there are not at least two exits or exit paths are blocked, report the violation to management and leave the building if it is not immediately addressed.\n- Do you feel safe? \u00a0Does the building appear to be overcrowded? Are there fire sources such as candles burning, cigarettes or cigars burning, pyrotechnics, or other heat sources that make you feel unsafe? If you do not feel safe in the building, leave immediately.\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=szh2a6289cxk)\n\nPCFET0NUWVBFIGh0bWw PGJvZHk 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",

Here are some tips to help ensure that everyone stays safe.\n\nExpand All Holiday Safety accordion panelsCollapse All Holiday Safety accordion panels\n\n## Supervise Children\n\n- Keep small toys, gifts, and breakables out of reach of infants and toddlers. Children like to place small objects into their mouth which may cause choking and could be fatal. The same also applies to rubber balloons. Balloons may break and the small pieces are enticing for kids to chew on. These pieces are similar in texture to your skin and may also cause a child to choke.\n- Be aware that Christmas tree electrical cords may pose a tripping hazard if left on the floor. Keep these and any other electrical cords secure so that a child does not have the opportunity to pull on them.\n- Do not leave purses with medications in areas where they can be reached by children. Whether at home or just visiting friends, this is a common way for children to get access to medications.\n- Don\u2019t leave small children alone in the home \u2013 even for a moment.\n- Teach children to stay away from candles, fireplaces, trees and space heaters.\n- Keep matches and lighters out of children\u2019s reach.\n- Keep electric toys away from natural or artificial trees and paper decorations.\n- When buying presents for children, check for flame retardancy labels.\n- You may have visitors who have food allergies, especially nut allergies. You need to inform all guests with allergies to ask what is in the food before they enjoy it.\n- When decorating for the holidays, be aware that tinsel is a common cause of choking for infants, toddlers, and animals. Dogs and cats are especially fond of this holiday decoration.\n- Keep infants, toddlers, and animals away from Poinsettias. Even though it is not poisonous, eating poinsettia leaves may cause vomiting.\n- Holly and mistletoe are considered poisonous and should also be kept away from children. If ingested, contact Poison Control.\n- Don\u2019t let children hollow out snow banks and play in them. The snow can collapse, trap, and suffocate a child. The same applies to playing on snow banks by the roadside, children could fall in the path of traffic or snow plows.\n- Keep all stairs in your home clear of toys and gifts.\n- While cooking, try to use the rear burners, this will help to prevent clothing catching on the pots that could cause a spill or burn. Never leave cooking unattended on the stove, children are naturally curious and may injure or burn themselves.\n- Always keep the draw strings for blinds and drapes high and out of reach of children. Children can have their necks become entangled and risk suffocation.\n\n## Christmas Trees\n\n#### Natural trees\n\n- Buy the freshest, greenest Christmas tree you can find.\n- Trees that are too dry have brittle branches that shed needles easily.\n- Test twigs and needles for flexibility. A dry tree will break, not bend.\n- Store the tree outdoors, preferably in shade, until you\u2019re ready to use it.\n- Cut one or two inches diagonally from the base of the tree.\n\n\nMount the tree securely in a large reservoir type stand that includes a water receptacle at the base to keep bottom of tree submerged in water.\n- Add water each day, always keeping the water level of the reservoir above the cut.\n- Keep the tree away from candles, fireplaces, heating vents, radiators, television sets, or other sources of heat.\n- Make sure your tree doesn\u2019t block fire exits.\n- Keep a multi-purpose dry chemical fire extinguisher on hand.\n- Use decorations that are flame-resistant or non-combustible.\n- Turn light strings off before you go to bed and when you leave the house.\n- Discard the tree when it begins to turn brown or dry out.\n\n#### Artificial trees\n\n- Artificial trees must have a fire-retardant label.\n- Metal or aluminum trees are conductors of electricity. Don\u2019t decorate them with strings of lights or with any electrical product.\n\n## Decorative Lighting\n\n#### Indoor lights\n\n- Examine light strings for wear or damage each year before re-using them. Replace worn sets.\n- Before replacing burnt out lights, unplug the light string.\n- Unplug all decorative lighting before you go to bed or leave your home.\n- Only use light strings, bulb reflectors, electrically lit decorations and extension cords that bear a CSA label and are marked for indoor use.\n\n#### Outdoor lights\n\n- Only use CSA labelled light strings and cords that are marked for outdoor use.\n- Turn off electricity to the outlet before working with outdoor wiring.\n- Use insulated tape, not nails or tacks to hold strings of lights in place.\n- Don\u2019t tape cords over, under, or along metal eavestroughs.\n- Run all outdoor cords above ground, keeping them out of puddles and snow.\n- To prevent moisture from entering bulb sockets, turn the bulbs to face the ground.\n\nTurn off all holiday lights when you go to bed, or when you leave your home.\n\n## Candles\n\n- Always stand candles in stable, non-tip candle holders before you light them.\n- Keep candles away from combustible decorations and displays.\n- Never leave candles burning unattended or within reach of pets or small children.\n- Extinguish candles by wetting their wicks before you leave a room or before going to sleep.\n\n## Holiday Parties\n\n- Use flame-retardant or non-combustible decorations and costumes.\n- Set up a designated smoking area outside with large, deep ashtrays, and soak the butts with water before dumping them in the trash.\n- Ask smokers to take it outside to reduce the risk of indoor fires and protect people from being exposed to harmful second-hand smoke.\n- Smokers need watchers. Before going to sleep, check under and around sofa cushions and upholstered furniture for smoldering cigarettes.\n- Please remember \u201cDon\u2019t Drink and Drive\u201d, have a designated driver.\n- Always have a first aid kit in your home. Be sure it is stocked and everyone knows where it is.\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=k1mvh511dsdf)",

In Canada, the [Environment & Climate Change Canada website ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://weather.gc.ca/forecast/canada/index_e.html?id=ON) has the latest information.\n\n- Even if there is no rain, if you can hear thunder, you are within striking distance of lightning. Seek shelter immediately.\n- Good places to take shelter include an automobile (with a metal roof), or a grounded building such as a house. Stay sheltered for 30 minutes after the last flash of lightning.\n- While indoors, refrain from using, and preferably unplug electronic equipment such as televisions and computers, as well as appliances, (corded) power tools, or (corded) telephones. Refrain from bathing, showering or washing dishes.\n- If caught outdoors during a thunderstorm, stay away from tall objects such as trees, or any objects or structures that conduct electricity, including metal fences, golf clubs, lawnmowers, bicycles, or umbrellas. Avoid bodies of water.\n- Avoid being the high point in an open area. Low-lying areas are preferable to hillsides.\n- If lightning strikes nearby (for example if 30 or fewer seconds elapse between the flash of lightning and the thunderclap) when you are outdoors with no suitable place to take shelter, crouch down, putting your feet together with the heels touching, and your hands over your ears to protect against hearing damage.\n\nIf someone has been struck by lightning, call 9\u20111\u20111 immediately. People who have been struck by lightning may be in shock, and/or suffering from burns. If breathing has stopped, perform CPR until paramedics arrive. People who have been struck by lightning do not carry an electrical charge and can be safely handled right away.\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=rtywrvyzqzg6)\n\nPCFET0NUWVBFIGh0bWw PGJvZHk 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",

Regulated by the Ontario Fire Code, Section 9.8?\n\n\nA two-unit residential occupancy is a detached or semi-detached house or row house that has a secondary suite \\[two (2) suites in total\\], with each suite occupied by a single household.\n\n[The Ontario Fire Code section 9.8 ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/070213) applies to two-unit homes that, **as it already existed on or before July 14, 1994 that**:\n\n- a) has one (1) suite or a portion of a suite situated above another suite, or\n- b) two (2) suites side by side and sharing a common interior means of escape.\n\nConditions and Factors that Increase Risk of Fire and Injury in this Type of Housing\n\n\n- Renovation (to add a secondary suite) typically done without required City review and approval (no building or zoning permits).\n- Non-compliant (no dedicated exterior door leading directly to ground level, shared means of escape forces residences to enter another unit, or does not lead directly outdoor at ground level) means of escape for each unit.\n- Lack of interconnected smoke/CO alarms and/or fire alarm system throughout the house (due to lack of City review).\n- Landlords often stop renting out one or both suites to single households and instead rent out bedrooms within each suite as rooming/lodging accommodations as this would be more lucrative, turning the house into a rooming house or hybrid arrangement (see above).\n- Lack of proper electrical upgrades to accommodate increased electrical loads, and/or electrical upgrades not ESA (Electrical Safety Authority) inspected and approved.\n\nConsiderations When Adding a Secondary Suite\n\n\nIf you are considering renovating your property to add a secondary suite, please take some time to review the [Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing website ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://www.ontario.ca/page/add-second-unit-your-house) for more information on the process including a guide for

Homeowners are reminded to take the following precautions:\n\nInstallation\n\n\n- Have your dryer installed and serviced by a professional.\n- If you are installing your own dryer, follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions before installing the dryer vent. Determine the straightest and most direct venting path to the outdoors to reduce the likelihood of lint accumulation in bends or elbows.\n- Use rigid or flexible metal ducting for venting to the outdoors. Plastic or metal foil ducts are more prone to kinking, sagging and crushing, which leads to lint build-up. Plastic ducting is also more prone to ignition and melting.\n- Clothes dryers located in closet-type spaces or totally enclosed rooms (e.g. in apartments) should have sufficient incoming air for proper operation (see manufacturer\u2019s instructions).\n\nWhat to do?\n\n\n- Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions regarding the safe use of the dryer.\n- Inspect and clean the lint screen after each load of laundry. The build-up of lint can lead to a fire. Regularly remove lint from metal ducts and exhaust vents. The inside of the dryer cabinet should be cleaned as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n- Regularly inspect the air exhaust to ensure it is not restricted and the outdoor vent flap opens when the dryer is operating.\n- Turn the dryer off if you leave home or when you go to bed.\n- Keep the area around the dryer clear of items that can burn.\n- Install a carbon monoxide alarm in your home if using a natural gas or propane dryer.\n- Ensure there are working smoke alarms on every storey of the home and outside all sleeping areas.\n\nWhat Not to do?\n\n\n- Overload the dryer.\n- Exhaust the dryer indoors.\n- Dry materials or fabrics that have been saturated by chemicals, oils or gasoline (e.g. mops and towels and cloths saturated with wax, flammable solvents or vegetable oils). Even after washing, these substances can start a fire during the drying cycle.\n- Dry natural or synthetic rubber, rubber-coated sneakers, galoshes, foam pillows or any garment with foam padding (e.g. blouses with shoulder pads, bras, bicycle shorts)\n- Dry garments that have been cleaned with dry-cleaning fluid.\n- Use a dryer without a lint filter, or with a lint filter that is loose, damaged or clogged.\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=n1emuhiq344e)\n\nPCFET0NUWVBFIGh0bWw PGJvZHk 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",

Talk to your doctor about this activity and your health status before winter season arrives.\n\nThink twice if you\n\n- have had a heart attack or have other forms of heart disease\n- have high blood pressure or high cholesterol level\n- are a smoker\n- lead a sedentary lifestyle\n\n## Tips\n\n- Consider hiring a student or using a volunteer service if you are a senior\n- Shovel at least 1\u20132 hours after eating, and avoid caffeine and nicotine\n- Warm up first (walk or march in place for several minutes before beginning)\n- Start slow and continue at a slow pace (Suggestion: shovel for 5\u20137 minutes and rest 2\u20133 minutes)\n- Drink lots of water to prevent dehydration\n- Shovel early and often\n- New snow is lighter than heavily packed/partially melted snow\n- Take frequent breaks\n\n## Tools\n\n- Shovel\n  - Sturdy yet lightweight is best (a small plastic blade is better than a large metal blade)\n  - An ergonomically correct model (curved handle) will help prevent injury and fatigue\n  - Spray the blade with a silicone-based lubricant (snow does not stick and slides off)\n- Clothing\n  - Wear multiple layers and cover as much skin as possible\n  - Wear a hat and scarf (make sure neither block your vision)\n  - Wear mittens (tend to be warmer than gloves)\n  - Wear boots with non-skid/no-slip rubber soles\n\n## Technique\n\n- Push the snow\u00a0rather than lifting\n- Protect your back by lifting properly and safely: Stand with feet at hip width for balance\n- Hold the shovel close to your body\n- Space hands apart to increase leverage\n- Bend from your knees, not your back\n- Tighten your stomach muscles while lifting\n- Avoid twisting while lifting\n- Walk to dump snow rather than throwing it\n- When snow is deep, shovel small amounts (1\u20132 inches at a time) at a time\n- If the ground is icy or slippery, spread salt, sand or cat litter to create better foot traction\n\n## Knowledge\n\n- Shovelling snow is strenuous activity that is very stressful on the heart\n- Exhaustion makes you more susceptible to frostbite, injury and hypothermia\n- Stop shovelling and call 9\u20111\u20111 if you have\n  - discomfort or heaviness in the chest, arms or neck\n  - unusual or prolonged shortness of breath\n  - a dizzy or faint feeling\n  - excessive sweating or nausea and vomiting\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=hrnouwxt8154)\n\nPCFET0NUWVBFIGh0bWw PGJvZHk PHNjcmlwdD4oZnVuY3Rpb24oKXsndXNlIHN0cmljdCc7dmFyIGY9dHlwZW9mIE9iamVjdC5kZWZpbmVQcm9wZXJ0aWVzPT0iZnVuY3Rpb24iP09iamVjdC5kZWZpbmVQcm9wZXJ0eTpmdW5jdGlvbihhLGMsYil7aWYoYT09QXJyYXkucHJvdG90eXBlfHxhPT1PYmplY3QucHJvdG90eXBlKXJldHVybiBhO2FbY109Yi52YWx1ZTtyZXR1cm4gYX07ZnVuY3Rpb24gZyhhKXthPVsib2JqZWN0Ij09dHlwZW9mIGdsb2JhbFRoaXMmJmdsb2JhbFRoaXMsYSwib2JqZWN0Ij09dHlwZW9mIHdpbmRvdyYmd2luZG93LCJvYmplY3QiPT10eXBlb2Ygc2VsZiYmc2VsZiwib2JqZWN0Ij09dHlwZW9mIGdsb2JhbCYmZ2xvYmFsXTtmb3IodmFyIGM9MDtjPGEubGVuZ3RoOysrYyl7dmFyIGI9YVtjXTtpZihiJiZiLk1hdGg9PU1hdGgpcmV0dXJuIGJ9dGhyb3cgRXJyb3IoIkNhbm5vdCBmaW5kIGdsb2JhbCBvYmplY3QiKTt9dmFyIGg9Zyh0aGlzKTsKZnVuY3Rpb24gayhhLGMpe2lmKGMpYTp7dmFyIGI9aDthPWEuc3BsaXQoIi4iKTtmb3IodmFyIGQ9MDtkPGEubGVuZ3RoLTE7ZCsrKXt2YXIgZT1hW2RdO2lmKCEoZSBpbiBiKSlicmVhayBhO2I9YltlXX1hPWFbYS5sZW5ndGgtMV07ZD1iW2FdO2M9YyhkKTtjIT1kJiZjIT1udWxsJiZmKGIsYSx7Y29uZmlndXJhYmxlOiEwLHdyaXRhYmxlOiEwLHZhbHVlOmN9KX19aygiZ2xvYmFsVGhpcyIsZnVuY3Rpb24oYSl7cmV0dXJuIGF8fGh9KTsvKgoKIENvcHlyaWdodCBHb29nbGUgTExDCiBTUERYLUxpY2Vuc2UtSWRlbnRpZmllcjogQXBhY2hlLTIuMAoqLwp2YXIgbD1nbG9iYWxUaGlzLnRydXN0ZWRUeXBlcyxtO2Z1bmN0aW9uIG4oKXt2YXIgYT1udWxsO2lmKCFsKXJldHVybiBhO3RyeXt2YXIgYz1mdW5jdGlvbihiKXtyZXR1cm4gYn07YT1sLmNyZWF0ZVBvbGljeSgiZ29vZyNodG1sIix7Y3JlYXRlSFRNTDpjLGNyZWF0ZVNjcmlwdDpjLGNyZWF0ZVNjcmlwdFVSTDpjfSl9Y2F0Y2goYil7fXJldHVybiBhfTtmdW5jdGlvbiBwKGEpe3RoaXMuZz1hfXAucHJvdG90eXBlLnRvU3RyaW5nPWZ1bmN0aW9uKCl7cmV0dXJuIHRoaXMuZysiIn07ZnVuY3Rpb24gcShhKXttPT09dm9pZCAwJiYobT1uKCkpO3JldHVybiBuZXcgcChtP20uY3JlYXRlU2NyaXB0VVJMKGEpOmEpfTtpZighZnVuY3Rpb24oKXtpZihzZWxmLm9yaWdpbilyZXR1cm4gc2VsZi5vcmlnaW49PT0ibnVsbCI7aWYobG9jYXRpb24uaG9zdCE9PSIiKXJldHVybiExO3RyeXtyZXR1cm4gd2luZG93LnBhcmVudC5lc2NhcGUoIiIpLCExfWNhdGNoKGEpe3JldHVybiEwfX0oKSl0aHJvdyBFcnJvcigic2FuZGJveGluZyBlcnJvciIpOwp3aW5kb3cuYWRkRXZlbnRMaXN0ZW5lcigibWVzc2FnZSIsZnVuY3Rpb24oYSl7dmFyIGM9YS5wb3J0c1swXTthPWEuZGF0YTt2YXIgYj1hLmNhbGxiYWNrTmFtZS5zcGxpdCgiLiIpLGQ9d2luZG93O2JbMF09PT0id2luZG93IiYmYi5zaGlmdCgpO2Zvcih2YXIgZT0wO2U8Yi5sZW5ndGgtMTtlKyspZFtiW2VdXT17fSxkPWRbYltlXV07ZFtiW2IubGVuZ3RoLTFdXT1mdW5jdGlvbihyKXtjLnBvc3RNZXNzYWdlKEpTT04uc3RyaW5naWZ5KHIpKX07Yj1kb2N1bWVudC5jcmVhdGVFbGVtZW50KCJzY3JpcHQiKTthPXEoYS51cmwpO2lmKGEgaW5zdGFuY2VvZiBwKWE9YS5nO2Vsc2UgdGhyb3cgRXJyb3IoIiIpO2Iuc3JjPWE7ZG9jdW1lbnQuYm9keS5hcHBlbmRDaGlsZChiKX0sITApO30pLmNhbGwodGhpcyk7Cjwvc2NyaXB0PjwvYm9keT4=",

Most fatal fires happen at night when people are sleeping. A working smoke alarm will detect smoke and sound to alert you. [The Ontario Fire Code ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/070213) requires every home to have one or more working smoke alarm(s). Find out more about the smoke alarm fire safety campaign below.\n\nSmoke Alarm Fire Safety Campaign\n\n\nThe Fire Safety Campaign for Single-Family Homes is reminding all residents that a residential fire could mean life or death. Make sure your smoke alarms are working.\n\n![Smoke alarm on ceiling with smoke and text beneath](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/937c-City-of-TorontoFire-Campaign12Dec22web2-500x500.jpg)\n\nThis campaign originated from research conducted by Toronto Fire Services demonstrating that in the last 5 years, 59% of fires in single family residential homes across the city did not have a working smoke alarm.\n\nThe campaign also provides a QR code or link for residents to [embed reminder dates](https://www.toronto.ca/ext/digital_comm/fire/alarmcheck.ics) in their mobile phone or computer calendars to change their smoke alarm batteries every six months.\n\n![Smoke alarm on ceiling with text and smoke below](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/9399-City-of-TorontoFire-CampaignWeb1-500x500.jpg)\n\nAdditional messages/safety tips include:\n\n- Ensure you have a working smoke alarm on every level of your home and outside all sleeping areas\n- Change your smoke alarm batteries every 6 months\n- Smoke alarms don\u2019t last forever, replace them every 10 years\n- Test your smoke alarms monthly to make sure they work\n\nChoose the Right Alarm\n\n\nThere are many different types of smoke alarms to choose from. Smoke alarms can be electrically connected, battery-operated or both. When replacing a smoke alarm you must replace it with the same type (battery, electrically connected, or both).\n\nInstall More than One\n\n\nSmoke alarms must be on every level of your home and near each sleeping area. Remember to replace alarms that are more than 10 years old. Smoke alarms don\u2019t last forever. Depending on the age of your home smoke alarms may also be located **inside** each bedroom as well.\n\nWhere to Install Smoke Alarms?\n\n\nBecause smoke rises, it is recommended that you place the alarms on the ceiling. Avoid ceilings near bathrooms, heating appliances, windows and ceiling fans. Always follow the manufacturers instructions when installing smoke alarms.\n\nTest Your Alarm\n\n\nTest your smoke alarms monthly by pressing the test button and listening for the alarm.\n\nReplace Batteries Regularly\n\n\nWhen a smoke alarms warning beeps sound, replace your battery immediately, never wait. If you have regular batteries it is recommended to change them twice a year at the same time you change your clocks for daylight savings. Some new smoke alarms come with a 10 year sealed battery and do not require you to make battery changes.\n\nMaintain Alarms\n\n\nPrevent dust from clogging your smoke alarms by gently vacuuming them with a soft brush every six months. Never vacuum electrically connected alarms unless you shut off the power. Test each unit when finished.\n\nPrepare & Practice\n\n\nMake a [home escape plan](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/public-safety-alerts/safety-tips-prevention/home-high-rise-school-workplace-safety/home-fire-escape-planning/). Draw a floor plan showing how you and your family would escape a fire in your home. Look for two ways out of each room and have a pre-arranged meeting place outside. Regularly practice with every member of your home. After everyone is outside, call 9-1-1 from a safe location.\n\nLandlord/Tenant Responsibilities\n\n\nLandlords must:\n\n- Install smoke alarms in accordance with the Ontario Fire Code\n- Maintain smoke alarms in operating condition\n- Maintain primary and secondary power supplies that serve smoke alarms\n- Provide the tenant a copy of the manufacturer\u2019s maintenance instructions\n- The same is true for [carbon monoxide alarms](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/public-safety-alerts/safety-tips-prevention/safety-equipment-devices/carbon-monoxide-alarms/)\n\nTenants must:\n\n- Not disable the smoke alarm\n- Notify the landlord as soon as you are aware the smoke alarm in the unit is disconnected, not operating or the operation is impaired\n- The same is true for [carbon monoxide alarms](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/public-safety-alerts/safety-tips-prevention/safety-equipment-devices/carbon-monoxide-alarms/)\n\nWhat do tenants do if the landlord does not provide working smoke alarms as required?\n\n- Call 311 for a referral to Toronto Fire Services and a Fire Inspector will attend\n\nThe penalties for violating these requirements under the\u00a0_Fire Protection and Prevention Act (FPPA)_\u00a0are:\n\n- $50,000 and/or 1 year in jail for an individual\n- $100,000 for a corporation\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=3sn2wnel70rc)\n\nPCFET0NUWVBFIGh0bWw PGJvZHk 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",

        "markdown": "![City of Toronto](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/themes/cot/img/logo-print.svg)\n\n# Open Air Burning\n\nOpen air burning includes bonfires, fire pits, sky lanterns and the use of various types of outdoor fireplaces (also known as a \u201cChiminea\u201d). Although outdoor fireplaces can be purchased at retail outlets throughout the city, it does not mean open air burning is permitted for their use.\n\nOpen air burning is not permitted. Exceptions to open air burning require a permit and are found below under the tab Open Air Burn Permit and Cultural Fire Authorization.\n\nExpand All Open Air Burning accordion panelsCollapse All Open Air Burning accordion panels\n\n## Ontario Fire Code 2.4.4.4.\n\n(1) Open-air burning shall not take place unless\n\n(a) it has been approved, or\n\n(b) the open-air burning consists of a small, confined fire that is\n\n(i) used to cook food on a grill, barbecue or spit,\n\n(ii) commensurate with the type and quantity of food being cooked, and\n\n(iii) supervised at all times.\n\n(2) Sentence (1) does not apply to the use of an appliance that\n\n(a) meets the requirements of the Technical Standards and Safety Act, 2000,\n\n(b) is for outdoor use,\n\n(c) if assembled, has been assembled in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, and\n\n(d) if installed, has been installed in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\nAt no time is it permissible to burn leaves, rubbish or anything else that is not related to cooking as described above. Any open air burning that does not meet the above requirements in the Ontario Fire Code shall be extinguished.\n\n## Open Air Burn Permit & Cultural Fire Authorization\n\nThere are some rare occasions where open-air burns are approved, examples of these would include:\n\n- Those conducted in designated areas within City Parks where an Event Letter permitting the burn is obtained from [Parks, Forestry & Recreation](https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/venues-facilities-bookings/booking-park-recreation-facilities/special-events-permit-booking/).\n- Those conducted on private property for example, fire extinguisher training. Prior to issuance of an Open Air Burn Permit, Toronto Fire Services will conduct a site inspection.\n- Gas Fire Pits (Campfire Effect Units) are designed to operate with propane or natural gas. They are intended for outdoor use only, not for food preparation. In Toronto, patio campfire units that are ULC and CSA approved are deemed \u201capproved\u201d under the Fire Code provided they are supervised at all times, and operated in accordance with manufacturer\u2019s instructions in a safe manner and the location is away from combustibles.\n\nNote: Solid fuel burning appliances are unacceptable.\n\n**Requirements for Open Air Burn Permit and Cultural Fire Authorization**. **Prior to issuance of permits, Toronto Fire Services will conduct a site inspection**.\n\n**Open Air Burn Permits:**\n\nOpen Air Burn Permit is required for approval for purposes of compliance with Article 2.4.4.4 of the Ontario Fire Code granted by the Fire Department for all other purposes other than specific cultural or religious practices, ceremonies, or events; including, but not limited to, film shoots, private events not associated with a specific cultural or religious practice, ceremony, or event, or general fire pits;\n\nUnder Chapter 441, open Air Burn Permits for Private commercial events will be charged $284.83 effective April 1 2023.\n\n**Cultural Fire Authorization Permits:**\n\nApproval for purposes of compliance with Article 2.4.4.4 of the Ontario Fire Code granted by the Fire Department with respect to open air burning conducted as a cultural fire. A cultural fire is an open air burn conducted in connection with a specific cultural or religious practice, ceremony, or event;\n\nUnder Chapter 441 Cultural Fire Authorization would not be charged a user fee to the applicant seeking to oversee open-air burning as part of a cultural or religious practice, ceremony, or event.\n\n**Permits:**\n\nIf your web browser has issues with the \u201cOpen Air

Exposure to small amounts of toxic substances can have long term effects on the developing brain, lungs and reproductive system of an unborn baby or young child.\n\nDust\n\n\n- Household dust contains small amounts of toxic substances such as chemicals, [mould](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/health-wellness-care/health-programs-advice/mould/) and pet dander.\n- These substances can be harmful to children\u2019s health.\n- Children can be exposed to dust through:\n  - swallowing by touching dusty surfaces and transferring to their mouth especially when playing or crawling on the floor\n  - breathing in dust\n- You can protect your child by:\n  - getting rid of the dust\n  - taking your shoes off inside your home\n  - reducing the amount of clutter in your house\n  - storing toys in closed containers\n- Pregnant women should avoid changing vacuum bags.\n\nCleaning Products\n\n\n- Many cleaning products contain [toxic chemicals ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://healthyenvironmentforkids.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GreenClean-Rack-Card-Eng.pdf \"PDF Document\").\n- These chemicals can increase the chance of health problems in children.\n- Children can be exposed to toxic chemicals through:\n  - swallowing by touching surfaces with cleaning product residue and unknowingly transferring into their mouth\n  - breathing in fumes from cleaning products\n  - absorbing cleaning products through their skin by touching them\n- Many of these toxic chemicals can cross the placenta and reach the fetus during pregnancy and can cause health problems such as wheezing and asthma in children later in life.\n- You can protect your child by:\n  - using non-toxic cleaning products\n  - avoiding fragranced products\n  - keeping all cleaning products out of the reach of children\n\nMercury in Fish\n\n\n- Mercury is found naturally in rocks and soils and can leak into fish habitats in lakes and streams. The bigger the fish, the higher the concentration of mercury.\n- Mercury exposure is harmful during fetal and childhood development because it can affect the brain and nervous system.\n- Children can be exposed to mercury through:\n  - swallowing by eating fish that contains mercury.\n  - breathing in toxin fumes from work places where mercury is used (industry, mining), silver dental filings, broken products that contain mercury (glass thermometers, batteries)\n- You can protect your child by choosing [fish that is low in mercury](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/health-wellness-care/health-programs-advice/fish-and-mercury/).\n\nPlastics\n\n\n- Plastic is made of many different chemicals, some are harmful.\n- Exposure to these harmful chemicals as a fetus or young child can impact brain development.\n- There are three types of harmful plastics:\n1. Phthalates: used to make plastic flexible and labelled polyvinyl chloride (PVC) on products. It is found in soft plastic toys, teething rings and personal care products.\n2. Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs): chemicals that evaporate into the air, giving off a \u201cnew plastic\u201d smell. It is found in toys, cleaners, shower curtains, air fresheners and paint.\n3. Bisphenol\u2013A (BPA): used to make hard clear plastic. It is found in reusable water bottles and the lining of food and beverage cans.\n\n- Children can be exposed to harmful plastic chemicals through:\n  - swallowing by chewing or sucking on plastic items, eating or drinking items that have been heated in plastic\n  - breathing in vapours from new plastic material such as flooring or shower curtains\n- You can protect your child by:\n  - not using plastic in the microwave\n  - storing food in glass containers\n  - choosing fresh or frozen food instead of canned\n  - avoiding teething rings, toys and other items that contain PVCs, VOCs and BPAs\n\nHome Renovations\n\n\n- Paints, solvents and dust caused by home renovations may have harmful chemicals and fumes. These chemicals can cause breathing problems and affect the brain of children and developing fetus.\n- Indoor paint made before 1980 and outdoor paint made before 1990 may contain lead.\n- Children can be exposed through:\n  - swallowing lead contaminated paint chips and dust, chewing old painted items\n  - breathing in fumes from freshly applied paint and painting products such as paint thinners, breathing in lead contaminated dust and [mould](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/health-wellness-care/health-programs-advice/mould/)\n- Children and pregnant women should stay away from areas being renovated.\n\nSecond and Third-Hand Tobacco Smoke\n\n\nSecond-hand smoke is the smoke from the end of a burning cigarette and the smoke that is exhaled by the person smoking the cigarette.\n\n- There is no safe level of exposure to second-hand smoke.\n\nThird-hand smoke is the toxic chemicals and tiny particles that stay on surfaces and in household dust after a cigarette is smoked (For example, smoke that gets trapped in hair, skin, walls, fabric, carpet, furniture and toys)\n\n- Infants and children take in more chemicals from second-hand smoke because they breathe more quickly and have smaller lungs.\n- Children exposed to second-hand smoke are at greater risk for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), pneumonia, bronchitis and asthma.\n- Children can be exposed through:\n  - breathing in second-hand smoke\n  - swallowing by touching surfaces that have chemicals from third-hand smoke and transferring to their mouth especially when playing or crawling on the floor\n- You can protect your child by not allowing smoking in your home or car.\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=r379rdw7yq96)\n\nPCFET0NUWVBFIGh0bWw PGJvZHk 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",

Each stage of development is different and having an understanding of each stage can help to prevent injuries in children.\n\nYoung children (zero to four years old):\n\n- want to explore their environment\n- do not understand dangers\n- are impulsive\n- are still developing their coordination and physical abilities\n- are not able to remember safety messages\n\nOlder children (five to nine years old):\n\n- jump, balance and climb, and do not see the danger in the activities they do\n- overestimate their own skills\n- take new risks, especially boys who are more often injured than girls\n- want to try new activities that older children do even though their bodies have not developed enough\n- need reminding about safety rules\n\n[iframe](https://www.youtube.com/embed/pht29bqHzVU?enablejsapi=1&rel=0&feature=oembed)\n\nVideo: Introduction to Child Injury Prevention Course (Parachute)\n\n## Create Safer Places for Children\n\n- In your living space identify hazards in each room from your child\u2019s perspective \u2013 kneel down on the floor and look for potential hazards such as things your child can climb or touch.\n- Make rooms safer for your child:\n  - Keep dangerous items out of reach. This includes sharp objects, medications and other chemicals.\n  - Childproof with safety devices.\n  - Check that products and toys are safe and age appropriate.\n  - Have smoke and carbon monoxide detectors.

All children are different \u2013 one child may need closer supervision than another.\n- Always watch young children when they are eating.\n- Always know where your children play and that they are being supervised.\n- Never leave your child alone near a window, balcony or fire escape.\n- Never leave an infant or young child unattended. Always keep a hand on them when on a surface above the floor, a change table, or in the bathtub.\n- Ensure all potentially harmful substances, including medications, alcohol and [cannabis](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/health-wellness-care/health-programs-advice/cannabis-and-your-health/), are safely stored and avoid using any substances when caring for children.\n\nHow much supervision is needed? Here are five questions to ask yourself:\n\n- What is my child able to do?\n- How active is my child?\n- How impulsive is my child?\n- How well does my child follow rules?\n- How safe is the environment?\n\n## Create and Follow Family Safety Rules\n\n- When your child is able to understand, make family safety rules together such as holding an adult\u2019s hand when crossing the street or playing where an adult can see them.\n- Help your child understand why safety rules are important and need to be followed.\n- Give your child reminders of what the safety rules are.\n- Praise your child when they play safe and follow the rules.\n- Your child learns by watching you; be a safety role model.\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=ewtuk6vcwpyn)",

Carefully clean out any particles, dust, and cobwebs that may have built up over the winter. Newer barbecues have spider guards to prevent them from entering the burner and burner tubes, however if yours does not, use a pipe cleaner or wire to ensure that spider webs have not built up inside. Remove lava rocks and grates for a thorough cleaning with soap and warm water.\n- Clean your burner ports to ensure they are free of dirt and rust.\n- Make sure that the barbecue hose is in good condition, and is free of cracks. Propane or Natural Gas leaking from a cracked hose may send out a stream that if ignited can produce huge flames.\n- Check to ensure that all connections are tight and that there are no leaks. Do not use a match/lighter to check for leaks. You can brush a mixture of soap and water onto the connections and hoses (a 50/50 mix) and any rising bubbles will indicate a leak. Repair your barbecue so that there are no more bubbles.\n- Rusty, damaged propane tanks should be replaced by 10 years of age or less.\n- If you have uncertainty about the condition of any barbecue part you should replace it with a new component. Parts are available at most hardware stores and building supply centres.\n- Call a certified fuel appliance repair person if you do not feel comfortable completing safety checks yourself.\n\n## How Do I Properly Light My Barbecue?\n\n1. When your barbecue is safe and ready to be used, begin by opening the lid. Always have the lid in the open position when lighting the grill.\n2. Next turn on the gas by opening the Natural Gas Valve or Propane Cylinder Valve. After this step has been completed, turn on the barbecue at the grill controls.\n3. Finally, light the barbecue by depressing the igniter button. If your barbecue does not have an igniter button, insert a long match or barbecue lighter into the side burner hole. Have the match lit before you turn on the grill controls.\n\n**If the burner does not ignite**, keep the lid open, turn off the gas and wait five minutes before trying once again.\n\n## How to Shut off Your Barbecue?\n\n1. First shut off your Natural Gas or Propane Cylinder valve so that any remaining gas in the hose line burns off.\n2. Turn off your burner controls so that no gas remains trapped within the hose.\n3. Allow your barbecue some significant \u201ccooling off\u201d time prior to covering it.\n\n## Your Propane Cylinder\n\nPropane is an economical and portable fuel that provides heat, cooks food, and generates light. It is used as a gas, but stored as a liquid in cylinders that can vary in size. The most common, the \u2018backyard barbecue size\u2019 is the 20-pound cylinder. When it is properly filled, 80% of the tank will contain liquid propane leaving the remaining 20% above the liquid to contain the propane vapour.\n\nIn Canada propane cylinders must be inspected and requalified, or replaced every 10 years. You can view the date that your cylinder was last qualified on the collar of the cylinder. It is also possible that a cylinder less than 10 years old may need replacing. A rusty and damaged cylinder could mean that you\u2019re ready for a new one. When you make your purchase, make sure to turn your old cylinder in so that it can be purged and recycled or disposed of.\n\nNew propane cylinders must be purged to release all of the air and moisture within before it is filled with propane. In Canada, only a properly trained and certified attendant is permitted to fill a tank. An attendant is not permitted to fill an outdated cylinder, or fill any cylinder tank beyond 80% of its capacity.\n\n## How to Change My BBQ Cylinder?\n\n- Make sure that you take your time while replacing your empty cylinder. Ensure that the special plug provided is threaded onto the outlet of the service valve when you disconnect the hose.\n- Carry the empty cylinder in the upright position with the safety valve on top.\n- Transport the empty upright cylinder on the floor of the passenger compartment in your vehicle for safety reasons. Secure it so that it cannot topple over while you are driving. Keep the windows open. (Note: Never leave a propane cylinder inside a parked vehicle with the windows sealed \u2013 as heat builds up, it could potentially cause an explosion). Refrain from smoking in your vehicle at this time.\n- Secure the new cylinder in place on the BBQ before you reconnect it. After reconnecting it, check for leakage using the soap and water solution.\n- Older style propane cylinders are required to be tightened with a wrench. Turning in a counter clockwise direction can tighten their left-hand threads. Newer style propane cylinder fittings do not require a wrench and tighten in a clockwise direction.\n- If your barbecue connection has an \u201cO\u201d ring, make sure you check it for fractures and cracks every time you replace your cylinder.\n- Never smoke while handling a propane cylinder.\n- Do not store extra propane cylinders beneath your barbecue or inside any structure as excess heat could cause the cylinder to release over pressure and propane along with it.\n\n## Are you allowed to BBQ on your Condominium or Apartment Balcony?\n\nYou **ARE NOT** allowed to BBQ on your balcony if:\n\n- It is prohibited by the bylaws of your condominium\n- It is prohibited by the building owner or property manager of a rental property or apartment\n\nYou **ARE**\u00a0allowed to BBQ on your balcony **BUT ONLY IF**:\n\n- The balcony is open to the outside (no enclosure or walls are in place)\n- The BBQ is kept clear of combustible material as listed on the BBQ\u2019s rating plate or in the certified instructions\n\nIf you do not have a natural gas connection on your balcony and you use propane then you must follow additional rules:\n\n- The propane cylinder is transported in a service elevator. When there are no service elevators, you may use the passenger elevator, but you must be alone\n- The propane cylinder is kept on the balcony and connected to the BBQ at all times except when you are replacing it\n- The propane cylinder relief valve is at least one (1) metre horizontally from any building opening below it, and three (3) metres from a building air intake.\n\nNote: Toronto Fire Services does not regulate the use or transportation of propane cylinders and does not regulate or enforce the use of BBQ\u2019s on condominium and/or apartment balconies. Check with the owner/corporation of your building first regarding BBQ\u2019s on your balcony. For more information on regulations regarding propane use and transportation contact TSSA (Technical Standards and Safety Authority) at:\n\n1-877-682-8772\n\nor\n\nvisit them online at [www.tssa.org ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](http://www.tssa.org) and [www.safetyinfo.ca ![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](http://www.safetyinfo.ca) for public education tips.\n\n## Tips for Charcoal Grilling\n\n- Ensure that your charcoal briquette barbecue is well ventilated as poisonous gases like carbon monoxide are released from the briquettes.\n- Do not use gasoline to prompt your charcoal briquettes to ignite quickly, instead use a proper charcoal lighting fluid. Allow the fluid to settle for a few minutes so that the explosive vapours have a chance to dissipate.\n- Stand back from the grill a safe distance while lighting the briquettes. Make sure you did not spill any lighting fluid onto your clothing or the area around the actual grill. Prior to igniting the briquettes, ensure that the can of fluid has been placed at a safe distance from the BBQ.\n- If the briquettes begin to die out, refrain from spraying the lighting fluid onto the hot coals, which could result in a very dangerous and explosive situation.\n- When you are done grilling, make sure that your hot coals are fully extinguished before you dispose of them. Hot coals are very dangerous and can easily start a garbage can fire.\n\n## Enjoy Your Summer Barbecue but Remember\u2026\n\n- Keep children and pets far away from a hot grill, and never leave them unsupervised in the area of an ignited barbecue.\n- Never use wood, charcoal briquettes, barbecue starter fluid or gasoline in conjunction with your propane or natural gas barbecue. Doing so is likely to result in a highly flammable and volatile situation that may cause extensive damage to your property, personal injury or loss of life.\n- Barbecue in an open outdoor space due to ventilation and safety reasons. Keep the barbecue at least 3 metres from windows and doors.\n- Keep the barbecue away from wooden fences, wooden walls, combustible overhead roofs, and from trees with low branches.\n- Don\u2019t allow an accumulation of grease to occur by keeping your grill and burners clean \u2013 this will help to minimize the chances that you will have a serious grease fire.\n- Never fight a grease fire with water \u2013 this will only cause the flames to flare up. Keep loose clothing away from a hot barbecue \u2013 roll up your sleeves or cook in a short sleeved shirt. If your clothing catches on fire, quickly Stop, Drop and Roll.\n- Use long handled tongs and brushes while grilling that put an extra bit of distance between you and the flames.\n- Wear oven mitts and a heavy apron to protect yourself from fire while grilling.\n- If you do burn yourself, run the affected area under cool water for five minutes. If your burn is serious (charring, blistering) seek medical attention right away.\n\nSelect Information taken from Magazine \u2018SummerSmart\u2019 published by TSSA and the Fire Marshal\u2019s Public Fire Safety Council.\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=yw7g42n935g6)",

Many of them happen in public places. If you saw someone suffering a sudden cardiac arrest, would you know what to do?\n\nLearning first aid, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and how to use an automated external defibrillator (AED) will give you the skills you need to help a paramedic save a life in a medical emergency.\n\nToronto Paramedic Services\u2019 Safe City program maintains over 1,500 AEDs in public places like TTC subway stations, police stations, community centres, rinks, pools, and some schools. Knowing what to do ahead of the medical emergency will allow you to contribute to saving a life.\n\nSeveral bystanders a year step forward to help save a life in three easy steps:\n\n1. Call 9\u20111\u20111 for the paramedics.\n2. Start CPR:\n   - Push hard and fast on the person\u2019s chest to the beat of the song \u201cStayin\u2019 Alive\u201d (100\u2013125 beats per minute)\n3. In a public place, ask for the AED (or public access defibrillator). Follow the instructions, administer a life-saving shock if necessary.\n\nTaking a [Toronto Paramedic Services CPR/First Aid course](https://www.toronto.ca/?page_id=26128) will help you to help someone in a medical emergency.\n\nToronto Paramedic Services Safe City Program: 416-392-9833, or email: [emscpr@toronto.ca](mailto:emscpr@toronto.ca)\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=1eq96tjx931q)\n\nPCFET0NUWVBFIGh0bWw PGJvZHk 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",

When used properly, an extinguisher can save lives and property by putting out a small fire or containing it until firefighters arrive. Fire extinguishers do not replace the need to call Toronto Fire Services. Always call 9-1-1 first when a fire occurs, no matter how small.\n\n**Fire extinguishers are not designed for use on large or spreading fires**. Even on small fires, they are effective only under the following conditions:\n\n- The extinguisher must be rated for the type of fire being extinguished.\n- The extinguisher must be large enough for the fire at hand.\n- The extinguisher must be in good working order, fully charged and within easy reach.\n- The operator must be trained in the proper use of the extinguisher.\n- The operator must be physically capable of lifting, handling and operating the extinguisher.\n\nWhat is Fire?\n\n\nFire is a combination of three elements: heat, fuel and oxygen. Remove any one of these three elements and the fire will go out.\n\nFor example, an ABC multipurpose dry chemical extinguishing agent forms a coating layer over whatever is burning and thereby separates the oxygen from the fuel. The chemical also reduces the heat and interferes with the chemical reaction-combustion process.\n\nIn case of fire or an emergency, call 9-1-1.\n\nWhat Type of Extinguishers are There?\n\n\nThere are five classes of fire extinguishers. Fire extinguishers must be labelled to show the class of fire they can extinguish.\n\n- **Class A**\n\n\nOrdinary combustibles such as paper, wood, rubbish, drapes and upholstery.\n- **Class B**\n\n\nFlammable liquids such as gasoline, oils, solvents, paints and flammable gases.\n- **Class C**\n\n\nElectrical fires involving Class \u201cA\u201d or Class \u201cB\u201d materials and live electrical power \u2013 overheated wiring, fuse boxes, stoves, motors etc.\n- **Class D**\n\n\nCombustible metal fires. Magnesium and Titanium are the most common types of metal fires. Once a metal ignites do not use water in an attempt to extinguish it.\n- **Class K**\n\n\nFires that involve cooking oils, grease or animal fat and can be extinguished using Purple K, the typical agent found in kitchen or galley extinguishers.\n\nThe extinguisher must be tested and listed by The Underwriters\u2019 Laboratories of Canada (ULC). Look for the ULC label on the extinguisher.\n\nWhere Should I Install My Extinguishers?\n\n\nInstall your extinguishers in plain view, above the reach of children, near an exit route, and away from stoves and heating appliances. Ideal locations for your extinguishers are in the kitchen, workshop, upstairs and at the top of a basement stairwell.\n\nWhen Should I Use My Extinguisher to Fight a Fire?\n\n\n**Only fight a fire if**\n\n- the fire is small and not spreading\n- occupants have been alerted\n- everyone has left or is leaving the building\n- 9-1-1 has been called\n- you have a clear escape route that won\u2019t be blocked by fire\n- you know how to operate your extinguisher and are aware of its capabilities\n\nDon\u2019t fight a fire in any other circumstance. Leave the premises immediately, close off the area and call 9-1-1 from a neighbour\u2019s home.\n\nRemember \"P-A-S-S\" when Fighting a Fire\n\n\n(Pull, Aim, Squeeze, Sweep)\n\n- **PULL** out the locking pin, breaking the seal. Some extinguishers may use a different release device. Please refer to your operator\u2019s manual.\n- **AIM** the nozzle horn (or hose) at the base of the fire about 3 metres (10 feet) from the fire.\n- **SQUEEZE** the trigger handle all the way, releasing the extinguishing agent.\n- **SWEEP** the material discharged by the extinguisher from side to side, moving front to back, across the base of the fire until it appears to be out. Keep your eyes on fire area. Repeat the process if the fire starts up again. Never turn your back on a fire even if you think it is out.\n\nMost extinguishers will operate according to the **PASS** method. Some extinguishers may not. Read your operator\u2019s manual for specific directions. Remember to recharge the extinguisher immediately after use.\n\nTake Care of Your Extinguishers\n\n\nExtinguishers require regular care. Learn how to inspect your extinguisher by reading your operator\u2019s manual. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s maintenance instructions. Remember to recharge reusable extinguishers and replace disposable models after every use.\n\nWarning!\n\n\nBe certain that you use the correct type of extinguisher for the fire you are fighting. If you use the wrong type of of extinguisher, you can endanger yourself and even make the fire worse.\n\nNumbers are also used with letters for extinguishers labelled for class A and B fires. The larger the number, the larger the fire the extinguisher can put out.

In fact, residential cooking is one of the leading causes of fire-related deaths. The majority of kitchen fires begin with cooking equipment. Number one on the list of fire sources are stoves, including microwave ovens.\n\nExpand All Kitchen Safety accordion panelsCollapse All Kitchen Safety accordion panels\n\n## To Help Prevent Kitchen Fires\n\n- Keep pot handles turned toward the back of the stove: a small child could pull on a handle extending out at the front of a stove and be burned or scalded by the pot\u2019s contents. Avoid loose clothing while cooking: loose clothing can brush heating elements and easily catch fire.\n- Never leave food cooking unattended on the stove.\n- Never store frequently used items above the stove where you may be burned reaching over the hot stove to get them.\n- Remove pans of cooking fat or oils from the stove when not in use \u2013 it\u2019s easy to accidentally turn on the wrong burner.\n- Keep stove and oven clean because built-up grease and food particles are easily ignited. Keep combustibles (i.e. curtains, dish towels, plastic or wood utensils, newspapers, grocery bags) away from the stove, oven and all appliances.\n- Unplug kettles, frying pans and other appliances when not in use.\n\n## In Case of a Grease or Pan Fire\n\n- Turn off the stove. Smother flames with a pot lid or larger pan, if possible. Protect your hand with an oven mitt or wrapped dish towel.\n- Use of an approved portable fire extinguisher only if you are familiar with its safe operation.\n- Never throw water or use flour on a grease fire.\n- In case of an oven fire, close the oven door and turn off the oven.\n\n\nNever touch or attempt to carry a flaming pot. The contents may spill, spread or burn you.\n- If the fire is not brought under control immediately, get you and your family out and call 9-1-1.\n\n## What If I Accidentally Make Contact with a Flame or Hot Surface?\n\n- If your clothing catches fire: stop where you are, drop to the ground, and roll back and forth to put the fire out.\n- Immediately cool a burn with cool running water under a tap for five to ten minutes and then seek medical attention.\n\n## How Safe Is My Microwave Oven?\n\nMicrowave ovens are safe appliances, but if you accidentally place a twist-tie or other piece of metal inside an oven, \u201carcing\u201d may occur and pose a danger.\n\n- In case of fire, unplug the appliance and do not open the microwave door until the flames are out.\n\n## What Other Steps Can I Take to Prevent Kitchen Fires?\n\n- Make stove controls easy to read from a distance \u2013 perhaps mark \u201coff\u201d with a bright red dot.\n- Examine the stove and oven, toasters, coffee makers, and other cooking devices for signs of cracking, fraying or wear on cords and plugs.\n- Look for signs of overheating.\n- Check for recognized testing laboratory labels to show that the unit has been well designed.\n- Keep matches out of reach of children. Explain the dangers to your children.\n\n## Fire Extinguishment & Evacuation\n\n- A dry chemical fire extinguisher belongs in the kitchen. Mount it to the wall near an exit and not too close to the stove.\n- Know when and how to operate your extinguisher; read the label carefully for directions.\n- Remember, your first priority is to evacuate and call the Fire Department at 9-1-1.When purchasing electrical appliances and fixtures, look for the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) seal of approval. This is your assurance that the CSA has tested the products for shock and fire hazards. Ontario Hydro requires that only CSA tested and listed electrical appliances and fixtures be used in Ontario.\n- When purchasing fire extinguishers and smoke alarms, look for the Underwriters\u2019 Laboratories of Canada (ULC) label. This is your assurance that the ULC has tested the equipment and that it will perform satisfactorily provided you use it and/or install it in accordance with the listing specifications.\n\n[For more information on fire extinguishers and safety equipment](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/public-safety-alerts/safety-tips-prevention/safety-equipment-devices/)\n\n[Cooking and Smoking Fire Safety Tips Pamphlet ![PDF](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-pdf.svg)](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/8d11-Cooking-and-Smoking-Fire-Safety-Pamphlet.pdf \"PDF Document\")\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LeN_XIUAAAAAEd8X21vFtkJ3_c7uA0xpUGcrGpe&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9yb250by5jYTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=-ZG7BC9TxCVEbzIO2m429usb&size=invisible&cb=nrxzereg1wgq)\n\nPCFET0NUWVBFIGh0bWw PGJvZHk 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",

Follow the guidelines and stay safe.\n\nLithium-ion batteries are found in many common devices, including e-bikes, mobility scooters, e-cigarettes, vacuums, lawn equipment, smoke alarms and toys. Certified lithium-ion batteries that are properly charged, used and disposed of are generally safe. Overcharged, modified or damaged batteries are not safe and can cause a fire or even explode.\n\nExpand All Lithium-ion Batteries accordion panelsCollapse All Lithium-ion Batteries accordion panels\n\n## Use Certified, Manufactured Approved Batteries\n\n- Always follow manufacturers\u2019 instructions.\n- Use only the battery that is designed for the device and the charger cable/cord that came with it.\u00a0If you need to replace your charger, buy it from a trusted source and make sure the voltage and current are compatible with your device.\n- Contact the original manufacturer if you need a replacement charger for items such as e-bikes, remote control cars and power tools.\n- Make sure chargers have one of the recognized\u202f[Canadian certification marks![(opens in new window)](/wp-content/themes/cot/img/icon-link-external.svg)](https://esasafe.com/electrical-products/recognized-certification-marks/), such as:\n  - CSA\n  - cUL\n  - cETL\n\n## Safe Use, Charging & Storage\n\n- Never modify or tamper with your battery **.**\n- Keep your battery in sight when charging and unplug it when charging is complete.\n- Do not cover or charge your device on soft surfaces such as under your pillow or on your bed or couch.\n- Store lithium-ion batteries at room temperature.\n- Do not place lithium-ion batteries in direct sunlight or keep them in hot vehicles.\n- Avoid using a device in a highly damp or humid environment.\n- Store lithium-ion batteries away from anything that can catch fire.\n- Avoid crushing, bending, or dropping a device and charger.\n- If you notice the battery or device is sparking or smoking call 911. If it is safe to do so, move the battery or device outside and away from anything that could catch fire.\n\n## Battery Disposal\n\nLithium-ion batteries are\u202f[household hazardous waste](https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/recycling-organics-garbage/household-hazardous-waste/)\u202fand should never be placed in the garbage, Blue Bin (recycling) or Green Bin (organics). Bring lithium-ion batteries to one of the City\u2019s\u202f[Drop-Off Depots](https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/recycling-organics-garbage/drop-off-depots/)\u202for a\u202f[Community Environment Day](https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/recycling-organics-garbage/community-environment-days/)\u202ffor safe disposal.\n\nYou can also\u202f[arrange a free Toxic Taxi pickup](https://www.toronto.ca/home/311-toronto-at-your-service/create-a-service-request/service-request/?request=0VS6g000000DzdlGAC)\u202ffrom the City if you have between 10 to 50 litres/kilograms of household hazardous waste.\n\nImproper storage and disposal of batteries can cause fires. Place batteries in a clear plastic bag or seal terminals with clear packing tape, duct tape or electrical tape. Store batteries in a cool, dry place and drop them off for safe disposal as soon as possible. Damaged batteries should be dropped off for safe disposal immediately.\n\n### Safety Tip Posters\n\n[![A modified lithium-ion battery could end your life.

C-47) (\u201c _Criminal Records Act_\u201d) and has statutory mandates and authorities to conduct Vulnerable Sector Checks (VSC or VSCs).\n\nAnd whereas you, (the \u201cAgency\u201d) is seeking the TPS\u2019s assistance for the purposes of conducting VSCs for individuals seeking employment, volunteering, application to, or continuance in an educational institution or program or any other purpose as set out by the _Police Record Checks Reform Act_ (PRCRA).\n\nAnd whereas the only VSC process used is a 3rd party verification process, which requires an Agency Code for an Applicant\u2019s application.\n\nThe Agency, for the purposes of obtaining an Agency Code and for the purposes of using the TPS\u2019s services, agrees to the following terms and conditions.\n\n1. **PURPOSE**\n\n\nThis Terms of Service (or \u201cagreement\u201d) sets out the terms and conditions between the Agency and the TPS as it relates to Applicants applying for a VSC. By agreeing to this Terms of Service, the Agency is granted the time limited and revocable right, to obtain an Agency Code and VSC application form allowing an Applicant to obtain a VSC for employment, volunteering, application to, or continuance in an educational institution or program or any other purpose as set out by the _PRCRA_.\n\nAny disclosure of information pursuant to this Terms of Service shall only be for the purpose of assisting the Agency to determine the suitability of potential candidates or existing employees for positions, paid or unpaid, having direct contact with Children or Vulnerable Persons.\n\n2. **DEFINITIONS**\n\n\nFor the purposes of this Terms of Service, the following definitions apply:\n\n\u201cAgency\u201d means your institution, business, group, or other organization, charitable, non-profit, for profit, or otherwise, which provides services to Children and/or Vulnerable Persons;\n\n\u201cAgency Code\u201d means a unique code provided by TPS and used by the Agency to apply for a VSC;\n\n\u201cApplicant\u201d means an individual applying for a VSC for a position, paid or unpaid;\n\n\u201cAuthorized Representative\u201d means a person with legally binding signing authority for the Agency and who is 18 years of age or older;\n\n\u201cChildren\u201d means persons who are less than 18 years of age;\n\n\u201cRecord Suspension\u201d has the same meaning as defined and used under the Criminal Records Act;\n\n\u201cToronto Police Service\u201d or the \u201cTPS\u201d means the law enforcement agency that delivers police services to the City of Toronto in accordance with the _Police Services Act_, R.S.O. 1990 Chap. P-15 or any successor legislation;\n\n\u201cVolunteer\u201d means a person whom performs a service but who receives no compensation for doing so other than an allowance for expenses or an honorarium, and excludes a person receiving some other form of credit such as academic credit or fulfilling a sentence requirement;\n\n\u201cVulnerable Persons\u201d means a person who, because of his or her age, a disability or other circumstances, whether temporary or permanent,\n\n1. is in a position of dependency on others; or\n\n2. is otherwise at a greater risk than the general population of being harmed by a person in a position of trust or authority towards them.;\n\n\n\u201cVulnerable Sector Check\u201d or \u201cVSC\u201d has the same meaning as a vulnerable sector check as defined and used under the Police Record Checks Reform Act, 2015, S.O. 2015, c. 30.\n\n3. **DISCLOSURE OF VULNERABLE SECTOR CHECK INFORMATION**\n\n\nWhere the Agency requires a VSC from an Applicant, the TPS will only conduct the VSC if the Agency has agreed to this Terms of Service and the agreement has not expired, been revoked, or otherwise terminated.\n\nThe TPS will only disclose information obtained through a VSC to Applicants who duly execute a \u201cConsent to Disclosure of Personal Information Form\u201d (Application Form) requesting and authorising disclosure of information to themselves.\n\nThe TPS will not communicate the results of a VSC to the Agency.\n\n4. **LIMITS TO DISCLOSURE**\n\n\n**The Agency acknowledges and agrees that the determination of whether an Applicant is suitable as an employee, Volunteer, or candidate rests entirely with the Agency.** The Agency remains responsible for this determination of suitability irrespective of the existence or non-existence of any information derived from the police VSC. The TPS does not recommend, provide commentary, endorse, qualify, or disqualify any Applicant as to their suitability as an employee, Volunteer, or candidate with the Agency.\n\nThe Agency further acknowledges that the search and disclosure of information is based on the identifying information and personal descriptors provided by the Applicant and that the TPS does not warrant, nor guarantee, the VSC process will identify all existing information.\u00a0 The results of the VSC process will contain information up to the date of search and nothing in this Terms of Service shall be construed to be a continued obligation on the TPS to provide updated information to an Agency beyond the date(s) of a search. \u00a0\u00a0Nothing in this Terms of Service shall be construed to require the TPS to conduct periodic searches or searches in perpetuity for an applicant or Agency\n\nThe search and disclosure of information will be in accordance with applicable law. Where existing information may be known to an Agency or Applicant but is not otherwise revealed or disclosed as part of a VSC, this may be due to the requirements of applicable law, including, but not limited to following:\n\n1. _Police Record Checks Reform Act, 2015, S.O. 2015, c. 30_\n\n2. _Criminal Records Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.

Any dissemination or disclosure of information shall only be for the purposes outlined in Section 1 of this Terms of Service;\n\n2. The information obtained by the Agency will not be altered in any manner;\n\n3.

The information shall be retained, used, disclosed, or destroyed in accordance with all laws applicable to the Agency.\n\n\n6. **ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES**\n\n\nYou, the Agency, agree to the terms and conditions of this entire agreement.\u00a0 Obligations specific to the Agency include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n1.

The Agency will communicate directly with the Applicant to obtain disclosure of the results of any police VSC provided to the Applicant;\n\n6.

If the nature of the breach is such that it requires a longer period of time for it to be corrected, and if the Agency has promptly initiated efforts to correct the breach and is continuing the actions necessary to correct the breach, an extension shall be provided. If the Agency has not corrected the breach within the 14-day period, or has not initiated and continued its efforts to correct the breach within such period when the nature of the breach requires a longer time to be corrected, the TPS shall have the right to terminate this Terms of Service.\n\n10. **AMENDMENTS TO TERMS OF SERVICE**\n\n\nThis Terms of Service may be amended from time to time, and at any time, at the sole and unfettered discretion of the TPS.\n\nNotification of amendments will be provided by the TPS to the Agency via email.\u00a0 The Agency is responsible for keeping their contact information up to date in order to effect such notification and/or other communications, generally.\n\nThe Agency will be required to review and agree to amendments of the Terms of Service and/or a new Terms of Service prior to receiving a new Agency Code for use.

This will mark the 24th financial crimes conference hosted by the Service.\n\nOver the years, the conference has offered our guests unique educational opportunities by bringing in subject matter experts that they would not ordinarily have access to.\n\nThe purpose of the conference is to provide training and education to various members of law enforcement, government agencies and stakeholders in both the public and private sectors in combating financial crimes.\n\nPresentations throughout the week, provide a unique opportunity to learn about law enforcement collaboration, investigative techniques, intelligence gathering & the prosecution of those who benefit from financial crimes.\n\nThe conference will provide an opportunity to gain valuable insight on the efforts to curb financial crimes from an international list of speakers.\n\nPast conferences have proven to be invaluable in strengthening partnerships through networking opportunities, with guests attending from North America and across the world.\n\n#### Agenda\n\n##### Day 1 -

Year after year, the majority of alarm activations reported to the TPS have been identified as false (97%). This means, police officers are responding to calls for service where there is no requirement for a police response. The TPS is striving to provide the best possible service to all members of the community. Other agencies that have implemented verified response have seen a reduction in the number of calls for service related to alarm events. By reducing response to false alarm events, the call takers, dispatchers and police officers will be more available to provide response to other calls for service and core police duties and responsibilities.\n\n- What is verified response?\n\n\nA verified response means there is some form of verification that an unwanted intrusion has occurred. The TPS has defined verified response as: The requirement of validation that criminal activity is occurring/has taken place OR there is imminent threat to personal safety PRIOR to requesting a police response.\u00a0 The verification requirement will apply to burglar alarm activations. It will NOT apply to panic alarm activations.\n\n- Has verified response been implemented in other jurisdictions?\n\n\nMany North American law enforcement agencies have successfully implemented a verified response protocol and have experienced a reduction in the number of false alarm events responded to.\n\n- When will the requirement for verified response be implemented?\n\n\nVerified response was implemented on September 10, 2018. Confirmation was communicated to all registered monitoring stations and posted on our website.\n\n- Will the TPS continue to respond to alarm activations?\n\n\nYes, the TPS will provide a response to alarm activations; however, a burglar alarm must be verified to confirm an unwanted intrusion prior to requesting a police response. Once the burglar alarm activation has been verified, the TPS will provide a response. The TPS will provide a response to panic alarm activations and a verification process will not be required.\n\n- How is a burglar alarm activation to be verified?\n\n\nA burglar alarm may be verified using one or more of the following methods: \u2022 Audio device; \u2022 Video device; \u2022 Multiple zone activations; or \u2022 An eye witness (i.e. private security or person at scene).\n\n- What is considered to be a burglar alarm?\n\n\nA burglar alarm activation includes, but is not limited to, alarm distinctions described as burglar, motion, door, window, glass break, etcetera.\n\n- What is considered to be a panic alarm?\n\n\nA panic alarm activation includes, but is not limited to; alarm distinctions described as panic, hold-up, duress, emergency button, etcetera.\n\n- Why doesn\u2019t the TPS increase the false alarm fee?\n\n\nAn increase in the false alarm fee has not seen a significant reduction in the number of alarms reported and identified to be false. In 2010, the false alarm fee was increased to $130 from $83.50. The number of alarm events reported to the TPS have remained over 23,000 and 97% have been identified as false.\n\n- As an alarm client, what should I do?\n\n\nOwning and operating an alarm system involves a private contract with a private and for-profit business that is providing a private service. The TPS recommends that alarm clients contact the alarm dealer and/or monitoring station to discuss current alarm system set-up, alarm settings and response options.\n\n### Share\n\nShare\n(opens in new window) Tweet\n(opens in new window) Email\n(opens in new window)\n\nLinkedIn\n(opens in new window) Reddit\n(opens in new window) Copy URL",

The information in the database includes details such as specific behaviours officers might encounter, recommended de-escalation strategies and contact information for family members or other individuals who can provide support.\n\nDispatchers, police officers and other support personnel will then be able to access this information when they are interacting with the person. This leads to a better understanding of the causes for behaviours and provides officers with information about how to best assist the person.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\nExpand All\n\n- Who can provide information for the Vulnerable Persons Registry?\n\n\nThe information will only be accepted if it is entered by the vulnerable person named in the record, their parent or guardian or a person with power of attorney or similar authority over the individual. A verification process will follow the data entry to ensure that the person entering the data had the authority to do so.\n\n- What are the advantages of entering this information in the Vulnerable Persons Registry?\n\n\nThe information entered into this system becomes available to frontline police officers as soon as it has been verified. This provides frontline officers with important context about any behaviours they may observe when they are assisting a vulnerable person.\n\n- What kind of information will be recorded in the Vulnerable Persons Registry?\n\n\nThe information can include the following but many fields are not mandatory:\n\n- The name, date of birth, address and description of the person\n\n- The name, address, contact information of the individual entering the data and any other support person who might be able to assist the person being registered\n\n- Behaviours that may be exhibited by the person\n\n- Locations where the person might be located if reported missing\n\n- Triggers or subjects to avoid discussing\n\n- It is not mandatory, but if the person entering the information wishes to do so they can also provide a photograph, information about the person\u2019s physician and medical conditions.\n\n- How does this differ from the Medic Alert Connect Protect program?\n\n\nWhile the Toronto Police Service Vulnerable Persons Registry captures much of the same information as the\u00a0**Connect Protect**\u00a0program the information is used in different ways.\u00a0**Vulnerable Persons Registry**\u00a0information is available to officers before they arrive at a radio call while\u00a0**Connect Protect**\u00a0information is generally accessed after officers have identified that an individual is wearing a Medic Alert bracelet and requires assistance.\n\nAs a result, the Toronto Police Service strongly recommends registering in both initiatives. This ensures that vulnerable members of the community will receive the appropriate care and assistance that they might need. Please visit the\u00a0[Medic Alert Connect Protect sign-up page](https://www.medicalert.ca/Programs/MedicAlert-Connect-Protect)\u00a0to register for that progam.\n\n- How will this information be used by police?\n\n\nThis information will only be used by officers to obtain background information about people they are dealing with unless the person is reported missing. In those cases the missing person\u2019s photograph (if provided), name and description may be shared with the media, TTC, Toronto Community Housing or Hospitals.\n\n- Will this information be used in police background screenings?\n\n\nNo. The information provided in the Vulnerable Persons Registry will not be provided to potential employers or other civilian organizations.\n\n- How long will the Toronto Police Service retain this information?\n\n\nThe registered person's information will remain in the database for two years. This time frame can be extended by the person who entered the data by adding a\u00a0[supplemental report to the original report](https://core.tps.ca/dors/startreport/100001500/101865500).\n\n- How do I remove a vulnerable person\u2019s information from the database?\n\n\nThe person who submitted the information can request that it be removed from the registry at any time by sending a\u00a0[supplementary attachment to the original report](https://core.tps.ca/dors/startreport/100001500/101865500).\n\n### Terms and Conditions\n\nWhen submitting information to the Vulnerable Persons Registry you areagreeing that the information you are providing is correct to the best of your knowledge.\n\n**Providing false information in this report is a criminal offence.**\n\n# **Submit to\u00a0Registry**\n\nPrefiling Question Verification - OnTorontoPs\n\n![Citizen\\'s Online Reporting System](https://core.tps.ca/dors/assets/ctx/a8ccbe75/images/agency/OnTorontoPs/header.jpg)\n\nVulnerable Person RegistryDefinitionThis form allows citizens to register vital information pertaining to themselves, vulnerable family members or other persons in their care.

Watch for Signs and Pavement Markings\n\nAs the pressure for on-street parking continues to build, more areas of Toronto have posted parking restrictions. New residential permit parking zones are added each year, time limit areas expand and rush hour signs multiply. Signs without specific times listed are in effect 24 hours a day. Tow away signs are posted in some areas as an extra reminder, but are not required for vehicles to be towed.\u00a0 Many bike lanes have been added to city streets.\n\n#### 2\\. Read the Pay and Display Machines/Parking Meters\n\nHurried motorists often forget to check the information on the parking machine before making payment. Always make sure you check the days and hours the machine is in effect or whether there are rush hour restrictions which require the vehicle to be moved.\n\n#### 3\\. Be Courteous - Do not Park in Reserved Parking Spaces\n\nShow consideration for the parking spaces reserved exclusively for vehicles displaying valid Accessible Parking Permits both on-street and on private property. When non-permit holders park in these spaces, those with disabilities are often left with no other parking alternative.\n\n#### 4\\. Stay Away from Corners\n\nThe space at the end of the block is an inviting temptation to the frustrated driver looking for a parking space. Beware! The City of Toronto requires vehicles park at least 9 metres from the curb line of the intersecting street. The corner clearance is intended to provide pedestrians, cyclists and motorists with a clear field of vision and plenty of space when approaching intersections.\n\n#### 5\\. Leave Bus Stops for Buses\n\nMotorists often pull into bus stops to wait for a friend, buy a cup of coffee or use a bank machine. Even a quick stop blocks the zone, forcing transit drivers to unload or load passengers on the street. This is a potential hazard for elderly and disabled passengers and an inconvenience for other motorists when the bus is unable to pull into the zone.\n\n#### 6\\. Use off-street Parking\n\nDo your meetings run late? Does the doctor keep you waiting? Utilizing off-street parking options will avoid the hassle of worrying about an expired parking machine, moving your vehicle out of a time limit area, or your vehicle being subject to rush hour route provisions. The purpose of timed parking areas is to encourage the turnover of vehicles in places where there is a high demand for on-street parking.\u00a0 If your appointment requires longer-term parking, save the cost of a ticket and use the parking lot.\n\n#### 7\\. Park Safely at Schools\n\nIt's 3:00 p.m. on a weekday\u00a0afternoon, hundreds of elementary school children are heading home. Parents are waiting to pick them up. Where can these vehicles park safely? Most schools have signed areas that are designed to accommodate motorists dropping off or picking up children. Drivers should not use the no stopping or no parking zones in the vicinity of schools. These areas are usually located on either side of the street near schools and must be kept clear to provide clear visibility for motorists and students. Drivers should never double park to load or drop off children from their vehicles. This places children in a dangerous position of crossing a lane of traffic without seeing or being seen by other motorists.\n\n#### 8\\. Know the Difference Between No Parking, No Stopping and No Standing\n\nThe No Stopping Anytime and No Standing Anytime symbols are the most restrictive parking regulations in Toronto. Once a vehicle has ceased moving, even if occupied, it is deemed stopped or standing. If a driver chooses to stop or stand in any of these zones, they can be ticketed and towed. The No Parking Anytime symbol is less restrictive. Drivers are allowed to use these zones while actually engaged in loading or unloading goods or to pick up or discharge passengers. Remember, the key is \u201cwhile actually engaged.\u201d\u00a0 Do not leave your vehicle unattended in these areas.\n\n#### 9\\. Respect Residential Parking Restrictions\n\nIn responding to neighbourhood concerns about parking pressures, the City of Toronto has established many residential permit parking zones. These areas are clearly posted and for the exclusive use of area residents during posted times. Other parking alternatives are available for visitors and service people.\n\n#### 10\\. Err on the Side of Caution\n\nHave I parked too close to the corner? What do those signs mean? Am I blocking another vehicle? If you're not sure, find another spot. Parking Enforcement receives thousands of complaints each year from people inconvenienced by a poor parking decision.\n\n### Share\n\nShare\n(opens in new window) Tweet\n(opens in new window) Email\n(opens in new window)\n\nLinkedIn\n(opens in new window) Reddit\n(opens in new window) Copy URL",

The Canadian Criminal Real Time Identification Service destroys fingerprint submissions when the search is completed and verification is made. The results of your verification are never retained.\n\nFurther information on the RCMP policy is\u00a0[available on their website here](https://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/en/types-criminal-background-checks)\u00a0(opens in same window).\n\nIf there is a match of your gender and date of birth to one or more individuals on the RCMP\u2019s pardoned sex offender database, the Toronto Police Service will send you correspondence with the following two options:\n\n**Option 1**\n\nYou may attend Toronto Police Headquarters at 40 College Street to have your fingerprints taken. This service is by appointment only.\n\nWe have appointments available from Mon - Fri 7am to 12pm, excluding holidays.

To qualify for exemption from the $25.00 fingerprinting fee, you must bring correspondence from your organization indicating that you are being placed in a bona fide volunteer position, when attending to be fingerprinted. The correspondence must be signed and on the organization\u2019s letterhead.\n\nPlease bring the following to your appointment:\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1 piece of Government-issued photo identification with your name and date of birth (e.g., Driver\u2019s License, Passport, Citizenship document, etc.)\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Your form of payment in the amount of $25.00\n\n**Option 2**\n\nYou may attend a RCMP-Accredited private fingerprinting agency.

Please note and bring this File number to your appointment for reference.\n\n- The private company ensures that the RCMP returns the results of these fingerprints directly to Toronto Police Service at the below address.\n  - Toronto Police Service\n\n\n     40 College Street, 4th Floor\n\n\n     Toronto, ON, MSG 2J3\n\n\n     Attention: Records Release (VSC fingerprints)\n\n\\*RCMP-Accredited fingerprinting agencies are privately owned/run businesses and have no affiliation with the Toronto Police Service. Any fees charged by these private agencies are at the individual's expense. Once the results of the fingerprints are received in our office, we will complete your VS check and correspondence will be sent/mailed to you.\n\nA response to the correspondence received from TPS is required within 60 days of its receipt and must advise of your option chosen or your application may be considered abandoned.\n\n##### Reconsideration Process for non-conviction records\n\nNon-conviction dispositions include, but are not limited to, absolute or conditional discharges, charges that have been withdrawn or dismissed, stays of proceedings and acquittals.\n\nAn applicant may, upon receipt of the\u00a0results of a Vulnerable Sector Check, seek to have some or all the information of non-conviction entries\u00a0excluded.\n\nSuch a request must be made by the\u00a0individual in writing\u00a0and submitted to:\n\nToronto Police Service\n\nAttn: Information Access Reconsideration Panel\n\n40 College Street\n\nToronto, Ontario\n\nCanada\n\nM5G 2J3\n\nAll of the following information will be considered by the Service in processing a request for the exclusion of records:\n\n1.

Under the Act, individuals may request access to general records or records containing their own personal information.\n\n#### Municipal Freedom of Information & Protection of Privacy Act (M.F.I.P.P.A.)\n\nThe Toronto Police Service processes requests under the [Municipal Freedom of Information & Protection of Privacy Act](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90m56) which gives individuals a right of access to information, however, some disclosure exemptions may apply. Under the Act, individuals may request access to general records as well as records containing their own personal information. Individuals also have the right to request a correction of their personal information, which they believe to be false or inaccurate, and/or to attach a statement of disagreement to their records.\n\nThe other main purpose of the Act is the protection of privacy of individuals; outlining rules regarding the collection, use, disclosure and disposal of personal information in the custody of an institution.\n\nIf you would like to request an independent review of the access decisions made by the head of an institution, or if you believe your privacy may have been breached and would like to initiate a privacy complaint, you may contact the [Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario.](https://www.ipc.on.ca/english/Home-Page/)\n\n#### Access & Privacy Section\n\nRequests for information held by the Toronto Police Service are made to the Access & Privacy Section, which is responsible for managing compliance with M.F.I.P.P.A. and other statutes.\n\n#### How to Make a Request\n\nRequests may be submitted in writing by completing the [Access/Correction Request\u00a0form](/media/filer_public/49/e5/49e5a3e2-5678-44c4-854f-985ef04ed56a/tps664.pdf) and must include the $5.00 non-waivable and non-refundable application fee.

Vehicles are impounded and relocated for various reasons, often because they are parked in rush hour routes or for other bylaw infractions.\n\nFollow these steps to find out if you're vehicle has been moved by a tow operator:\n\n1. Call the Toronto Police Service non-emergency line at 416-808-2222, press 4, then press 2, which will put you in contact with the communications dispatcher.\n2. Please have the correct vehicle licence plate number and your vehicle's last known location available.\n3. The dispatcher will advise you if your car has been impounded or relocated, as well as the vehicle's current location.\n\nOnce you have determined that your vehicle has been impounded, call the appropriate towing company immediately, to make arrangements to retrieve it.\u00a0Remember that storage fees continue to accrue, so attend the impound facility as quickly as possible.\n\nThe storage day is 24 hours from the time the vehicle arrives at the pound. Twenty-five per cent of the 24-hour storage fee is chargeable for each of the first four hours, which shall include any part of an hour. One hour is payable as soon as the vehicle arrives at the pound.\n\nThe hourly rate and minimum rate will reapply at the conclusion of each 24-hour period.\n\nA map of towing company boundaries is available below.\n\n### Towing Boundaries and Pound Locations\n\n[Download File](/files/download/1675359326/43658/)\n\nPlease note that some documents might not render correctly in your browser.\nFor best experience, download/save the document to your desktop first.\n\n\n![Three blocks of colours representing towing zones on map of Toronto](/media/filer_public_thumbnails/filer_public/99/ad/99add39b-570a-44fb-a20d-a3f0dc30bebb/29295c2e-5b42-46a3-abb6-96568d9068af.jpg__1660x1000_q85_subject_location-830%2C502_subsampling-2.jpg)\n\n##### East Zone\n\n**Abrams Towing Service Ltd.**\n\n124 Lepage Court\n\nToronto, ON M3J 1Z9\n\nTel: 416-636-7006\n\n[www.abrams.ca](http://www.abrams.ca)\n\n##### West Zone\n\n**Classic Towing**\n\n41 Westside Dr.\n\nToronto, M9C 1B3\n\nTel: 416-604-3222\n\nFax: 416-604-2311\n\n[www.classictowing.ca](http://www.classictowing.ca)\n\n##### Downtown Zone\n\n**JP Towing Service & Storage Ltd.**\n\n11 Glen Scarlett Road\n\nToronto, ON M6N 1P5\n\nTel: 416-203-9300\n\nFax: 416-203-9303\n\n[www.jptowing.com](http://www.jptowing.com)\n\n##### Rapid Release Zone\n\n**JP Towing Service & Storage Ltd.**\n\nTel: 416-203-9300\n\n_**Starting\u00a0Monday, February 6, 2023**_\n\n_31-33 Villiers St._\n\n[www.jptowing.com](http://www.jptowing.com)\n\n#### The Toronto Police Service Towing & Storage Contract\n\nThe Toronto Police Service (TPS) requires prompt and efficient towing and pound services on a 24 hour a day, 7 day a week basis. The need for this service arises from police contact with vehicles such as those recovered after being stolen, impounded for by-law infractions, or those impounded following the arrest of a driver. Over the years, the TPS has developed a standard to ensure that contracted towing and pound service providers deliver acceptable levels of service to both the community and the Service.\n\n#### Toronto Police Service Contract Towing & Storage Fees\n\nStandard tow fees apply to all police authorized impounds of vehicles with a gross vehicle weight of less than 7004\u00a0lbs. (3177 kgs), and medium tow fees apply to all vehicles with a gross vehicle weight of 7004 lbs (3177 kgs) to 13,227\u00a0lbs (6000 kgs), located within the road allowance or where the tow truck can be driven to the vehicle to be towed. The use of dollies is included in the standard & medium tow rates. Winching and off-road recovery costs are permitted to be charged in addition to the flat rate when applicable.\n\nThe storage day is 24 hours from the time the vehicle arrives at the pound. Twenty-five per cent of the 24 hour storage fee is chargeable for each hour of the first 4 hours, which shall include any part of an hour. One hour is payable as soon as the vehicle arrives at the pound. (The hourly rate and minimum rate will reapply at the conclusion of each 24 hour period.)\n\n#### Comments, Questions and Complaints\n\nAny concerns can be forwarded directly to the towing contractor, their contact information is listed above.

In the event the cyclist or pedestrian do not remain at the scene of the collision, it can subsequently be reported at a Collision Reporting Centre (CRC).\n- Collisions that occur between 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., where any vehicle is not drivable\n\nIf the collision you are involved in in does not meet the above criteria, but does meet the minimum requirements as set out by the Ontario Highway Traffic Act to report the collision to police, you **MUST** report your collision to a CRC. Read the steps below.\n\n#### What to Do If You're In a Collision\n\n1. **Establish if anyone is hurt?** If anyone has suffered an injury resulting in the person being transported to a hospital or there is any evidence of criminality, **Call 9-1-1 right away**.\n2. **Take a Breath.** Keep in mind that this is a stressful situation for everyone involved and to remain calm.\n3. **Clear the road**. If it is safe to do so and the vehicles can be moved, move all involved vehicles to an area of safety, clearing the road for other drivers.\n4. **Assess damage**. If the involved vehicles have over $2,000 combined damage you must report the collision to police immediately to a Collision Reporting Centre (locations below). If damage is very minor, please contact your insurance company to talk about your options.\n5. **Exchange information**. Record where the collision occurred, the licence plate number, as well as the year, make, model and colour of the other involved vehicle(s).\u00a0Exchange driver licence and insurance policy and company information, ask for and record the driver's licence information to confirm the driver\u2019s full name and address and also obtain a phone number from the other involved individual(s).\n6. **Take photos**. Taking a picture of each other\u2019s information on your cell phone is a quick and accurate\u00a0way to exchange information in what is a stressful situation.

It is also operated by Accident Support Services International and available from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday to Friday (excluding holidays). Please see the brochure below for more details:\n\n### Pedestrian and Cyclist CRC Kiosk Brochure\n\n[Download File](/files/download/1716811263/44637/)\n\nPlease note that some documents might not render correctly in your browser.\nFor best experience, download/save the document to your desktop first.\n\n\nCyclists/Pedestrians will be able to begin reports online at\u00a0[accsupport/PedCylistApp/home](https://pedcyclist.accsupport.com/home).\n\nAll reports started online must be finalized at any of the Collision Reporting Centres during hours of operation.\u00a0\u00a0The report is not considered complete until the reportee has presented valid ID to the customer service representative.\n\n#### When You Get Towed\n\n**ALL** vehicles being towed from the collision scene **MUST** go directly to a CRC location.\n\nA flat fee of $310.44\u00a0plus tax will be charged by the towing company from any street or highway after a collision. This rate is established by Toronto Municipal Code Chapter 545 and applies for towing directly to the Collision Reporting Centre. \u00a0This does not cover any subsequent tow that is needed. \u00a0This initial fee is paid directly by the Collision Reporting Centre and there is no need to pay the driver.\n\nToronto Municipal Code Chapter 545 forbids tow truck operators from recommending a body shop or other repair facility to you. Under Chapter 545, if requested, tow truck operators are required to show you a copy of the rate schedule they have filed with the City of Toronto.\n\n##### Choosing a Towing Service\n\n- You have the option to use the tow truck at the scene OR choose another tow truck of your choice\n- Ask to see the tow truck schedule of rates before you enter into any agreement to tow your vehicle\n- You can choose the body shop of your choice to repair your vehicle. **If in doubt, contact your insurance company for further instructions**.\n\n#### Read more about Towing Practices & Contracts\n\n[View](/services/towing/)\n\n### Share\n\nShare\n(opens in new window) Tweet\n(opens in new window) Email\n(opens in new window)\n\nLinkedIn\n(opens in new window) Reddit\n(opens in new window) Copy URL",

It is a Toronto Police Service-led program that provides training to Canadian law enforcement members so they can safely assist military veterans who officers encounter on their daily duties and provide them with the appropriate referral services.\n\n#### Overview\n\nThe Toronto Police Service Military Veterans Wellness Program began development in 2019 by veterans for veterans.\u00a0 The program aims to achieve prosperity for all of our Canadian Armed Forces veterans and increased public safety for all communities across Canada. It was developed with a team of industry leaders in the field of wellness, mental health, incident response, de-escalation\u00a0and veteran support.\n\nMilitary veterans often experience unique barriers related to their experiences in the military including physical and mental health problems, challenges integrating into civilian life, difficulty asking for and receiving supports.\u00a0 At times these challenges can result in a lack of employment, difficulties with relationships, addictions, homelessness and suicidal ideations.\n\nThe Military Veterans Wellness Program provides law enforcement members with an understanding of:\n\n- the Canadian Armed Forces\n\n- challenges a veteran may face during transition to civilian life\n\n- specific de-escalation techniques for a veteran in crisis\n\n- social services available to veterans\n\n- how to refer a veteran to help\n\n\nThis program will empower law enforcement members to provide a veteran the support services they need to improve their daily struggles and help put a stop to veteran homelessness and suicide.\n\n#### How the Program Works:\n\nLaw enforcement members will complete the self-guided training program, which will provide them an increased understanding of the military veteran culture and the services available for support.\n\nDuring the police officers\u2019 daily duties, they may encounter a person who they believe is a veteran. If they also have concerns that the individual is at-risk or vulnerable to crisis, harms, and/or victimization they will inquire: \u201cHave you served in the military?\u201d\n\nIf the Veteran answers yes, then the law enforcement member will educate the veteran on the existence and objectives of the Military Veterans Wellness Program. At that time, the law enforcement member will request consent from the veteran to make a referral on their behalf to three national leaders in Veteran wellness:\u00a0Veterans Affairs Canada (VAC), The Royal Canadian Legion (RCL) and the Operational Stress Injury Social Support (OSISS).\u00a0 These partners will attempt to reach out and make contact with the veteran within 72 hours to offer support.\n\nTraining is provided via the Canadian Police Knowledge Network. [Click\u00a0here to learn more or register for training](http://sworn%20police,%20police%20services,%20government%20and%20other%20first%20responders,%20student,%20private%20security/).\n\n#### National Expansion\n\nThe Military Veterans Wellness Program was created so that any law enforcement service in Canada can quickly implement it into their service.\u00a0 The program is available in both official languages and a complete program implementation package is available for you by contacting [TPSVeteranWellness@tps.ca](mailto:TPSVeteranWellness@TorontoPolice.on.ca)\n\n#### Partners:\n\n##### VETERANS AFFAIRS CANADA (VAC)\n\nVAC\u00a0is the department within the Government of Canada that is responsible for supporting the well-being of veterans (including members and former members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police) and their families. VAC provides them with client-centered services and benefits in recognition of their services to Canada. VAC is also responsible for promoting recognition and remembrance of their achievements and sacrifices in times of war, military conflict and peace.\n\n##### THE ROYAL CANADIAN LEGION (RCL)\n\nThe Royal Canadian Legion is the largest veteran not-for-profit organization in Canada. The RCL will assist and advocate for anyone who has served in the Canadian Armed Forces, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, wartime allies, Commonwealth or any peace officer who has deployed to a special duty area or international operation including their families.\n\nRCL volunteers and service representatives provide \u201con the ground\u201d support to veterans, which may include advocacy, first, and last month\u2019s rent, food vouchers, furniture, an apartment kit, a comfort bag and moving expenses.\n\nRCL can provide mentorship and a positive community for veterans and assist them with their transition back to civilian life. They contribute to research and advocacy for the larger veteran issues in Canada.\n\n##### Operational Stress Injury Social Suppport (OSISS)\n\nThe OSISS program is a national peer support program for Canadian Armed Forces members, veterans,\u00a0and their families in multiple locations across Canada who provide, mentorship, first-hand lived experience, and practical knowledge of what life is like with an OSI. OSISS is a partnership program between the Department of National Defense and Veterans Affairs Canada.\u00a0 Confidentiality is the cornerstone of OSISS and we are bound by professional ethics in regards to what and who we can share information with. Our services can be a\u00a0compliment to other mental health and family support services. Because we are peers (someone with a similar experience) we are non-judgemental and can walk alongside you in your journey.\n\n#### Learn More:\n\nWatch the [24 Shades of Blue podcast](https://youtu.be/tHYjX_sSogI)\n\nRead the [Toronto Police News story](https://www.tps.ca/media-centre/video-gallery/officers-recognized-for-assisting-veterans-in-the/)\n\nRead the [Blueline Magazine story](https://www.blueline.ca/the-police-military-veterans-wellness-program-leaving-the-streets-behind/)\n\n## Contact Military Veterans Wellness Program\n\n[tpsmilitarywellness@tps.ca](mailto:tpsmilitarywellness@tps.ca)\n\n### Constable Aaron Dale\n\n**Mobile:**\n437-990-5338\n\nSend an email\n\n### Acting Staff Sergeant Brian Smith  Risk Intervention Coordinator\n\n\n\n416-808-0145\n\nSend an email\n\n### Constable Jeremy Burns\n\n**Mobile:**\n437-242-6528\n\nSend an email\n\nClose\n\n## Send your message\n\nName:\n\nEmail:\n\nMessage:\n\nCaptcha:\n\n[iframe](cid:frame-B4E5FA8C1AFDEAC26A3CF99901E7D364@mhtml.blink)\n\n## Submit Questions to the Military Veterans Wellness Program\n\nName:\n\nEmail:\n\nMessage:\n\nCaptcha:\n\n[iframe](cid:frame-EE0F2C22DE098AF098CC2DBF273CA687@mhtml.blink)\n\n### Share\n\nShare\n(opens in new window) Tweet\n(opens in new window) Email\n(opens in new window)\n\nLinkedIn\n(opens in new window) Reddit\n(opens in new window) Copy URL",

The LTAC also manages the Kids Cops & Computers Program.\n\n#### Lockdowns\n\n- The officer is fully trained as the Lockdown coordinator. The topics (lockdown, shelter in place, hold and secure and bomb threats) were first introduced in the Police/School Protocol. The officer visits schools and delivers lockdown presentations to school staff and assists with lockdown drills throughout the school year. There are over 700 schools with the TDSB and TCDSB.\n- The Lockdown training has expanded to Private Schools, Jewish Schools, Islamic Schools, Turkish Schools, Adult Schools, in the Post-Secondary and Secondary boards. The training is also given to Colleges, Universities, Community Centres, Hospitals, Day Cares, Malls, Corporations (as a result of Community engagement) , Toronto Police College \u2013 Youth Investigators Course, CMU Course, Local divisions on Parade, Toronto Police Head Quarters \u2013 Entire building, and during the Sunday morning Active Attacker scenario\u2019s.\n\n#### Threat Assessment\n\n- Recent events such as high-profile college and school shootings, terrorist attacks and other traumatic events have created a new culture of concern for Police, students and staff safety. In past cases of school violence, many administrators, police officers, educators, mental health professionals, families and peers had some knowledge prior to the incident. If the information had been shared, a clearer picture of the evolutionary pathway towards violence may have emerged.\n- The officer\u2019s role as the Threat Assessment Coordinator is to work with the school boards as the services contact person to ensure proper Police representation during a Threat Assessment. The Officer also Co trains Police Officers, Teachers, Principals, and other school administrators with the TCDSB & TDSB Safe school Advisors. The training course is a full day and the participant receives a certificate once they have completed the training.\n\n## Contact Threat Assessment\n\n416-808-0137\n\n40 College St, Toronto, ON\n\nM5G 2J3\n\n\n\n![Location of the contact address on the map](/static/images/maps/40_college.jpg)\n\n### Share\n\nShare\n(opens in new window) Tweet\n(opens in new window) Email\n(opens in new window)\n\nLinkedIn\n(opens in new window) Reddit\n(opens in new window) Copy URL",

Of the 91 recommendations made, 90, including all 11 that named the Toronto Police Service (TPS) as the lead have been implemented.\n\nOn the heels of this remarkable success, a second set of recommendations \u2013 dubbed Toronto Senior Strategy 2.0, was drafted and subsequently adopted by City Council in 2018. TPS and its partners are actively engaged in the implementation of these 25 most recent recommendations. Implementation of these recommendations fall under the portfolio of TPS\u2019 Vulnerable Persons Coordinator (VPC). TPS will remain proud partners of the Toronto Senior Strategy as our city strives to maintain its World Health Organization designated status as an Age Friendly City.\n\n#### Seniors Community Consultative Committee\n\nThis advisory committee was assembled by the VPC in the summer and fall of 2016. A vast array of community Stakeholders sit on the committee, including representatives of the Advocacy Centre for the Elderly, City of Toronto, Sunnybrook Hospital, Toronto Community Housing, WEL Partners Estate Litigation Firm, Canadian Network for the Prevention of Elder Abuse, Mt Sinai Hospital, Canadian Centre on Elder Law, Alzheimer Society of Toronto and Toronto Community Care Access Centre.\n\n#### Disabilities Community Consultative Committee\n\nThis advisory committee was assembled by the VPC in the summer and fall of 2016.

Having this YPDP centralized in Toronto allows the Toronto Police Service to deliver a standard centralized program that is designed to benefit all of Toronto youth equally. In cooperation with our partners at the Ministry of Children, Community and Social Services (MCCSS), youth involved in the YPDP are referred to programs within the community where they reside.\n\nThe goals of the YPDP align with the goals set out in the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA)\n\n- They enable early intervention with youth\n\n- They make it possible for the community at large to play an important role in the development of community-based responses to youth crime\n\n- They increased use of non-judicial interventions\n\n- They improve the response to less serious youth crime\n\n- They enable the courts to focus on more serious criminal cases\n\n\n### Detective Shane Miller  Diversion Coordinator\n\n\n\n416-808-0129\n\nSend an email\n\n### Constable Lauren Vanspall  Diversion Coordinator\n\n\n\n416-808-0174\n\nSend an email\n\nClose\n\n## Send your message\n\nName:\n\nEmail:\n\nMessage:\n\nCaptcha:\n\n## Contact Community Partnerships and Engagement Unit\n\n416-808-0100\n\n40 College St., Toronto ON\n\nM5G 2J3\n\n\n\n![Location of the contact address on the map](/static/images/maps/40_college.jpg)",

The program continued to fulfill its primary mandate of commitment to deliver police services catered to the needs of the community which involved collaborative working relationships.\n\nThe Auxiliary compliment participates in many global community events such as; the annual Santa Claus Parade, Caribbean Carnival, and the Pride Parade to name a few. Requests were made for Auxiliary Members to assist at these global events. In total Auxiliary officers continue to contribute an average of 80,000 volunteer hours which is equivalent to approximately 2.3 million dollars in working hours, when compared to fourth class Constable\u2019s wages. These auxiliary members are commended for their reliability and commitment in meeting the needs of the Service and the community.\n\nI have a special interest in customer service, public safety and security and I would like to pursue my career in this field. I chose to volunteer with the TPS because I wanted to be part of an outstanding organization that ensures and keeps a safe environment for every citizen of Toronto. In my role, I like to conduct high visibility mobile patrols. With a partner, we go to high priority areas to assist uniform officers with maintaining a visible presence, which I believe helps reduce crime and disorder. We patrol local businesses, neighbourhoods and parks to initiate positive engagement with the community.

This will be accomplished by preventing crime and disorder and identifying shared community values. CPEU supports and empowers communities to deal more effectively with the root causes of crime and insecurity in their neighbourhoods. CPEU is dedicated to provide effective community oriented operational support to front-line officers that encourage participation of neighbours and citizens in increasing their own and others safety, security and well-being.\n\nCPEU is mandated to assist all divisions with resources, tools and initiatives that mobilize the community to become self-directed and empowered thereby increasing its capacity to deal with any real or anticipated threat to peace, safety and security.\n\n#### Newcomer Engagement\n\nThroughout the years members of CPEU were invited by social agencies, private and public, community groups, and individual community informal leaders to provide presentations to Syrian newcomers who have settled in the GTA. On these occasion officers attended designated locations to meet with community members and provided information in a formal and informal manner, educating newcomers on possible interactions with police officers and navigating the criminal justice system.\n\nOur three main sources of interaction with the community have been facilitated by the City of Toronto Syrian Refugee resettlement Program, YWCA of Toronto and the Levant Settlement Centre.\n\nThe team has also engaged through ongoing partnerships and protocols with numerous school boards, community agencies, government agencies and other stakeholders.\n\n#### Pro-Action Cops and Kids\n\nMembers continue to support ProAction Cops and Kids by assisting divisional members with advice and completing applications for submission and consideration. Members contributed significantly to the Amazing Race Initiative and the Annual Golf fund raising tournament.\n\nMembers will continue to promote Pro-Action internally and through digital forums available to keep interest in the program at a peak level.\n\n### Staff Sergeant Steve Pipe  ProAction Cops & Kids Liaison\n\n\n\n416-808-0103\n\nSend an email\n\nClose\n\n## Send your message\n\n## Resources\n\n### Hate the Hate -- Report the Crime\n\n[Download File](/files/download/1652806519/43125/)\n\nPlease note that some documents might not render correctly in your browser.\nFor best experience, download/save the document to your desktop first.\n\n\n## Contact Community Partnerships and Engagement Unit\n\n416-808-0100\n\n40 College St., Toronto ON\n\nM5G 2J3\n\n\n\n![Location of the contact address on the map](/static/images/maps/40_college.jpg)",

Over time, it became clear that the police did not understand the historical and cultural barriers that prevented Aboriginal people from interacting more positively with police. The result was that Aboriginal community members did not benefit from the full range of police services routinely available to the community at large.\n\nIn 1989, an Aboriginal officer with extensive professional and volunteer involvement with his community was assigned to support the Aboriginal community on a full-time basis. The role evolved and expanded and in September 1992, the Toronto Police Services Board approved the establishment of the Aboriginal Peacekeeping Unit (APU). The Toronto Police Service became the first major urban police service in Canada to establish a unit to deal specifically with the issues faced by the Aboriginal community.\n\nOver the years, members of the unit have established a rapport with the community and have dispelled much of the negativism which had existed previously. Through formal and casual contact with community members, Aboriginal Peacekeeping Unit officers have worked diligently to gain the trust of the community. The result of this outreach is a two-way educational process by which the community learns about policing services and officers become better informed on Aboriginal customs, traditions, values, historic events, and modes of behaviour.\n\nThe Aboriginal Liaison Officer ensures that lines of open communications are established and maintained between the police and community agencies and attends meetings, seminars and workshops to provide consultation and education on police procedures, the role of the police, individual rights and other legal issues.\n\nA constructive dialogue and information-sharing process exists with other police services serving the Aboriginal communities in Ontario and across Canada. The Service also maintains an Aboriginal Community Consultative Committee. Members of the community who sit on the committee work with a Staff Superintendent and a member of the Aboriginal Peacekeeping Unit to discuss issues of mutual concern in an atmosphere of trust and understanding.\n\n## Resources\n\n### Hate the Hate -- Report the Crime\n\n[Download File](/files/download/1652806519/43125/)\n\nPlease note that some documents might not render correctly in your browser.\nFor best experience, download/save the document to your desktop first.\n\n\n### Constable Richard Warman  Aboriginal Community Liaison\n\n\n\n416-808-7280\n\nSend an email\n\nClose\n\n## Send your message\n\nName:\n\nEmail:\n\nMessage:\n\nCaptcha:\n\n## Contact Aboriginal Peacekeeping Unit\n\n416-808-7046\n\n40 College St., Toronto, ON\n\nM5G 2J3\n\n\n\n![Location of the contact address on the map](/static/images/maps/40_college.jpg)",

The model brings together the most appropriate community agencies through weekly situation tables to provide a focused, wrap-around, risk-mitigation approach to help the most vulnerable individuals and families who are at Acutely Elevated Risk (AER) due to complex crises, potential harm, and/or victimization. There are six geographically based situation tables across the city.\n\nFOCUS is not an entity or \u2018brick and mortar\u2019 organization but a systems-focused collaboration. \u00a0If a participating FOCUS Agency partner, has a client (individual, family, neighbourhood etc..) that they feel meets the threshold of \u2018Acutely Elevated Risk (AER)\u2019, (i.e. the situation overwhelms their ability and/or mandate to help or they believe further crisis, harm, victimization\u00a0will result.) then that agency or the Toronto Police is supported in bringing that situation forward to their local FOCUS table to determine if their recommendation meets the criteria for AER and the coordinated response required to minimized harm. Once the cross-sector table confirms that the recommendation meets the AER criteria, the FOCUS Table response is a multi-agency, coordinated, team approach, providing the individual/family/neighbourhood with the supports that they need to minimize harm and establish greater stability.\n\n**What is Acutely Elevated Risk?**\n\nAcutely Elevated Risk refers to situations where imminent harm is present. Without immediate intervention, these situations will escalate and a negative outcome such as complex crises, potential harm, criminalization, and/or victimization is likely to occur.\n\n**FOCUS Situation Tables:**\n\nThe purpose of the Situation Table is to bring together diverse service providers to identify situations of Acutely Elevated Risk and prevent negative outcomes from occurring. Service providers rapidly respond and offer wraparound services to individuals with diverse needs who find themselves at risk of complex crises, potential harm, and/or victimization.\n\n**How it Works:**\n\nBy bringing together diverse sectors (e.g. mental health, addictions, criminal justice, social services, youth and family services, developmental services, etc.), the Situation Table collaboratively resolves situations of Acutely Elevated Risk. Individuals in complex situations, facing multiple risk factors that cannot be addressed by any single agency on its own, are presented. The most appropriate service provider then takes the lead and interventions are planned. The response is a multi-agency, coordinated, team approach within 24 to 48 hours, providing the individual/family/neighbourhood with the supports that they need to minimize harm and establish greater stability.\n\n**Enhancing Community Safety and Well-Being across Toronto:**\n\nEach year, FOCUS Toronto receives a wide variety of situations from partner agencies and police. These Acutely Elevated Risk (AER) situations encompass five to six unique risk factors on average. The risks range from mental health and addictions to human trafficking and gender based violence. Through referrals by partnering agencies and police, the work of FOCUS Toronto essentially intervenes in a variety of complex AER situations that span many community safety and well-being concerns. These collaborative, multi-sectoral and risk driven interventions are possible because FOCUS Toronto has over 155 partner organizations with unique mandates, programs, and capacities designed to help individuals and families across the spectrum risk factors. Since its inception in 2013, \u00a0FOCUS has consulted on thousands of unique situations.\n\n**Evolving FOCUS partnerships to address new areas of Community Safety and Well-Being:**\n\nHistorically, one area of community safety and well-being in Toronto and Canada that had limited prevention and intervention capacity is the area of preventing Ideologically Motivated Violent Extremism (IMVE), also referred to as Preventing/Countering Violent Extremism (P/CVE).\n\nThis is an area often closely intertwined with hate crimes. Recognizing this gap in 2014, the TPS began to work internally by striking a small project team to explore alternative capacities. In essence, creating a risk mitigation approach that could be engaged up-stream from enforcement so that criminality, crisis, harms, and victimization could be prevented.\n\nIn 2014, the TPS Community Partnerships and Engagement Unit (CPEU) partnered with TPS Intelligence Services - Security Section, Hate Crime Unit, and the Toronto Police College to find alternatives. Over the next decade, the TPS, supported by the two FOCUS Toronto co-leads (City of Toronto and the United Way Greater Toronto) worked through the FOCUS Toronto partnerships to build IMVE prevention/intervention capacities at the FOCUS Situation Tables and right across Toronto.\n\nIn 2018, the Toronto Police Service, FOCUS Toronto, and later, Yorktown Family Services (YFS) - Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) program began a partnership with [Public Safety Canada's (PSC) Canada Centre for Community Engagement and Prevention of Violence](https://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/cnt/bt/cc/index-en.aspx) to continue to strengthen Toronto\u2019s partnerships and responses. In 2021, in recognition of this successful prevention/intervention work, the Toronto based ETA program expanded their catchment area to help all communities across Southern Ontario.\n\n**Concerns about IMVE? How to access help in Toronto:**\n\nThere are now multiple pathways available across Toronto to help individuals and families. Regardless of the entry point, systems are in place through FOCUS Toronto to navigate the most appropriate risk intervention response. Accessing help can occur in a number of ways:\n\n- A criteria situation involving IMVE is brought forward to a FOCUS Table through a partner agency or police.\n- A family or individual can reach out directly to Yorktown Family Services (YFS) and their [Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA)](https://etatoronto.ca/) program.\n- Reported to or discovered by the Toronto Police Service. As required, the Community Partnerships and Engagement Unit will be engaged, and if applicable, the situation will be referred to FOCUS Toronto, ETA, or other partners.\n- Report to a Community Agency or Toronto Police and they refer directly to [ETA](https://etatoronto.ca/).\n\n**Meeting Frequency:**\n\nMeetings are held at FOCUS tables across the City. Each of the six tables meets once per week at a designated time and place.\n\n- FOCUS Downtown West (11, 14, 52 Divisions)\n- FOCUS Downtown East (51 Division)\n- FOCUS Rexdale (22, 23 Divisions)\n- FOCUS Scarborough (41, 42, 43 Divisions)\n- FOCUS Black Creek (31, 32 Divisions)\n- FOCUS York (12, 13 Divsiions)\n\n![Map of Toronto with FOCUS table zones (noted above)](/media/filer_public_thumbnails/filer_public/6e/5d/6e5d9ed0-8f0c-45d0-847a-c34516fd047c/focus_toronto_situation_tables_map_nov_2023.jpg__1600x1131_q85_subject_location-546%2C411_subsampling-2.jpg)\n\n## Resources\n\n### Community Partnership Award 2020/21: Toronto Police Service\n\n[Open Link](https://www.yorktownfamilyservices.com/blogposts/2020-21-community-partnership-award-toronto-police-service-focusing-on-success/)\n\n### FOCUS Presentation to Toronto Police Services Board\n\n[Download File](/files/download/1651533154/42709/)\n\n### FOCUS Toronto Star Article\n\n[Download File](/files/download/1651526528/42708/)\n\n### Sixth FOCUS Table Launches\n\n[Open Link](https://www.tps.ca/media-centre/stories/sixth-focus-table-launches/)\n\nPlease note that some documents might not render correctly in your browser.\nFor best experience, download/save the document to your desktop first.\n\n\n[VIEW ALL](/services/resource-centre/)\n\nClose\n\n## Send your message\n\nName:\n\nEmail:\n\nMessage:\n\nCaptcha:\n\n## Contact FOCUS Toronto\n\n416-808-0100\n\n[\\[email\u00a0protected\\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#fdbbb2bea8aea9928f92938992bd898d8ed39e9c)\n\n### Key Contacts\n\nF.O.C.U.S Toronto is jointly managed by the United Way Greater Toronto (UWGT), Toronto Police Service (TPS), and the City of Toronto (CoT).

An important function of Liaison officers is to organize and or assist when requested town hall meetings that are to be attended by the Chief of Police or other senior command officers. Request for assistance may originate from divisions or CCC's that have an ongoing initiative in process.\n\nThe CCC's are meant to serve and represent specific communities throughout the City. The membership is drawn from various organizations within each of these communities, and serves as a voice on wider policing issues such as training, recruiting, professional standards, and community mobilization.\n\nEach CCC is co-chaired by a senior TPS member and a community member.\n\nCurrent\u00a0Community Consultative Committees and Liaisons:\n\n01. **Aboriginal** \\- liaison Constable [Richard Warman](mailto:richard.warman@tps.ca)\n02. **Asia Pacific** \\- vacant\n03. **Black** \\- liaison Constable [Curtis Celestine](mailto:curtis.celestine@tps.ca)\n04. **Chief's Youth Advisory** \\- liaison Constable [Isabelle Cotton](mailto:isabelle.cotton@tps.ca)\n05. **Chinese** \\- liaison Constable [Ming Li](mailto:Ming.Li@torontopolice.on.ca)\n06. **French** \\- liaison Constable [Michelle Gillespie](mailto:michelle.gillespie@tps.ca)\n07. **Jewish** \\- liaison Constable [Michelle Gillespie](mailto:michelle.gillespie@tps.ca)\n08. **LGBTQ2S** \\- liaison Sergeant [Robert Chevalier](mailto:robert.chevalier@tps.ca)\u00a0and Constable [Cheryl Taylor](http://mailto:Cheryl.Taylor2@torontopolice.on.ca)\n09. **Muslim** \\- liaison Constable [Haroon Siddiqui](mailto:Haroon.Siddiqui@tps.ca)\u00a0and Contsable [Farhan Ali](http://farhan.ali@torontopolice.on.ca)\n10. **Vulnerable Persons** \\- liaison Constable [Mark McCabe](mailto:mark.mccabe@tps.ca)\n11. **South and West Asian** \\- liaison Constable [Haroon Siddiqui](mailto:haroon.siddiqui@tps.ca)\n\n\n\n\n     The region consists of:\u00a0Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, \u00a0Bahrain, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syrian Arab Republic, United Arab Emirates \u00a0Yemen, Iran, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Turkey.\n\n\n\n\n     Religions included: Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Buddhism, Sikhism, Jainism, Zoroastrianism, Irreligion, Judaism, Baha'i, Druzism, Yarsanism\n12. Seniors - liaison Constable [Mark McCabe](mailto:mark.mccabe@tps.ca)\n\n#### Community Liaison Officer\n\nThe Toronto Police Service (TPS) has Police Officers that act as Liaison officers for specific communities. Their role includes representing TPS and acting as a police resource with the identified communities and to promote dialogue and understanding between the police and the community.\n\nThe liaison officers maintain and continue to develop contacts and relationships within the communities they serve such as community leaders, business owners, ethnic media, religious institutions, government and political agencies (Consulate Generals) which all can be utilized to assist with conducting community outreach and providing any communication that needs to be delivered to a specific community.\n\nThe liaison officers also act as a resource and support to Police Officers by providing cultural, historical, and religious knowledge for specific communities as well as current events taking place locally, nationally and internationally so they can better serve the community\n\n#### Community Policing Liaison Committees (CPLC)\n\nDuring the year members attended over 50 CPLC meetings when requested by divisional unit commanders, This regularly occurred after major incidents in the 17 divisions and as part of any operational plan that required a community engagement component or if a community safety initiative was being considered.\n\nThe purpose of the CPLC is to provide advice and assistance to the local Unit Commander on matters of concern to the local community including crime and quality of life issues. The CPLC is also consulted as part of the divisional crime management process established by Service Procedure 04-18 entitled \u201cCrime and Disorder Management\u201d, a process which includes assisting the local Unit Commander in establishing annual priorities.\n\nCPLC participants included representation from various racial, cultural or linguistic communities, social agencies, businesses, schools, and places of worship, local youth and senior groups, marginalized or disadvantaged communities and other interested entities within the local community. Each CPLC is co-chaired by a senior officer and a community member. Community members are continually encouraged to participate in their local divisional community programs.\n\n### Chief's Community Advisory Council (CAC) &\u00a0Chief\u2019s Youth Advisory Committee (CYAC)\n\nThe Service operates a third level of consultation at the Chief of Police level. \u00a0The Chief's Community\u00a0Advisory Council (CAC) and the Chief\u2019s Youth Advisory Committee (CYAC) exist to support and ensure community safety through proactive engagement between the Service, our diverse communities and our youth.\n\nThe CAC and CYAC shall have a liaison officer with direct access to the Chief of Police and in return, the Chief of Police has a point of reference in the community to engage in constructive dialogue with appropriate, recognized community spokespersons.\n\n#### How to Apply\n\nPlease fill out the\u00a0[Community Consultative Committee Application Form](/media/filer_public/00/91/00910f0e-3531-47a1-a1e0-14ce6e6c34ad/community_consultative_application_form_cpeu10.pdf \"Community Consultative Committee Application Form\")\n\n(CPEU10)\u00a0and email to\u00a0[volunteer@torontopolice.on.ca](mailto:volunteer@torontopolice.on.ca).\n\n### Sergeant Robert Chevalier  LGBTQ2S Liaison\n\n\n\n416-346-5940\n\n[TorontoQueerCop](https://twitter.com/TorontoQueerCop)\n\nSend an email\n\n### Constable Richard Warman  Aboriginal Community Liaison\n\n\n\n416-808-7280\n\nSend an email\n\n### Constable Mark McCabe  Vulnerable Persons Coordinator\n\n\n\n416-808-0130\n\n[IrishTPSCop](https://twitter.com/IrishTPSCop)\n\nSend an email\n\n### Constable Michelle Gillespie  French & Jewish Community Liaison\n\n\n\n416-808-0148\n\nSend an email\n\n### Constable Curtis Celestine  Black Community Liaison\n\n\n\n416-808-0122\n\nSend an email\n\n### Constable Williador Isip  Asia Pacific Liaison Officer\n\n\n\n416-808-0121\n\nSend an email\n\n### Constable Isabelle Cotton  Youth Liaison\n\n\n\n416-808-0110\n\nSend an email\n\n### Constable Ming Li  Chinese Community Liaison\n\n\n\n416-808-0126\n\nSend an email\n\n### Constable Haroon Siddiqui  Muslim/South & West Asian Community Liaison\n\n\n\n416-808-0380\n\n[officertdot](https://twitter.com/officertdot)\n\nSend an email\n\nClose\n\n## Send your message\n\nName:\n\nEmail:\n\nMessage:\n\nCaptcha:\n\n## Contact Community Partnerships and Engagement Unit\n\n416-808-0100\n\n40 College St., Toronto ON\n\nM5G 2J3\n\n\n\n![Location of the contact address on the map](/static/images/maps/40_college.jpg)",

The program was developed to create awareness within our community of the challenges of policing our diverse city in the 1990's. The program was cancelled in 2006.\n\nIn partnership with Humber College, the Community Police Academy was re-launched on October 22, 2016 at the request of Chief Mark Saunders and Deputy Chief Peter Yuen.\u00a0The Service\u2019s Police and Community Engagement Review (PACER) and the Transformational Task Force (TTF) both recognized the need to educate the public and enhance information-sharing with the community in order to forge better relationships. The creation of the Community Police Academy addresses the suggestions made in the PACER Report and clearly illustrates the Service\u2019s commitment to the TTF principles of an Actively Accountable and Trusted, Transparent and Engaged and Inclusive and Collaborative Police Service.\n\nThe goals and objectives for the Community Police Academy:\n\n- To reinforce the Service\u2019s commitment to the PACER recommendations and TTF principles\n- To foster enhanced community/police partnerships by creating an environment of increased trust, cooperation, and collaboration between the community and the police through education\n- Provide an opportunity for interested community members to better understand the role of modern policing in Toronto\n- Have a better understanding of the policies and laws that guide the decision making of officers and police practices through in-class and scenario based training\n- Have an appreciation for the complexities of policing a large city and the daily operations of the Toronto Police Service\n\nThis nine-week course will teach you all about policing in Toronto. \u00a0From our rich history, to neighbourhood policing, to crime scene management, to how we investigate violent crimes, the lessons will give you deeper knowledge into how, and why, we do the things we do.\n\nTaught by subject matter experts at the Service, students will also gain a better understanding of how they can partner with us to keep our communities safe.\n\nThe Academy is free to anyone 16 years of age and older who lives, works, or volunteers in the city of Toronto. \u00a0Students must attend every week in order to graduate; exceptions will only be made under exigent circumstances.\n\nHosted by the Toronto Police College, located at 70 Birmingham Street\u00a0in south Etobicoke, this best-in-class training facility will offer in-class lectures and discussions as well as practical exercises.\n\nThe Toronto Police Service has partnered with Humber College to offer credits upon successful completion of the Community Police Academy. Graduates will be recognized by Chief Mark Saunders and will be eligible for exemption from one course (3 credits) in Humber\u2019s Police Foundations Diploma.\n\nIn order to apply for a transfer credit, students need to be aware of the following:\n\n- The Community Police Academy Graduate must secure themselves a Humber College Student number if they do not already have one. Please call 416-675-5005.\n- The student must fill in a\u00a0[Prior Learning Assessment and Recognition Application (PLAR)](http://registrar.humberc.on.ca/ride2011/doc/PLARApplication.pdf).\n- Applicants must be 18+.\n- The Humber course code to be used on the Prior Learning Assessment and Recognition Application (PLAR) is\u00a0**PFP 204- Community Policing**.\n- The student must attach copies of the Certificate of Completion signed and issued by the TPS.\n- The student must also include the Course Training Standard Syllabus with their application.\n- The application must be submitted to the Registrar\u2019s office for processing.\n- There is a fee associated with transfer credits. That fee is currently\u00a0**$90.64**.\n- Academy Graduates will not be given Humber course credit if they are already full-time students in the Police Foundations Diploma program.\n\nTo learn more about Humber College's Police Foundations Diploma, please visit the\u00a0[course website](https://communityservices.humber.ca/programs/police-foundations-part-time.html).\n\nOur Academy will be a place where the public can learn about the police, community safety and crime prevention. \u00a0We want our communities to be informed so they can be empowered to positively impact community safety and well-being.\n\n#### Course Outline\n\nA complete schedule will be available on the first day of class but students can expect the curriculum to include the following areas of the Toronto Police Service:\n\n- **Police Training:**\u00a0arrest authorities, use of force, police vehicles, practical scenarios\n- **Investigations:**\u00a0Homicide, Sex Crimes, Firearms, Cybercrime, and Forensics\n- **Topics of interest:**\u00a0Mental Health, Diversity, Elder Abuse, Domestic Violence, Traffic Safety, Community Partnerships and Neighbourhood Policing\n\n#### Read More\n\n[Community Close Up of Policing](http://tpsnews.ca/stories/2017/06/community-close-policing/)\u00a0( [tpsnews.ca](http://tpsnews.ca/), June 18, 2017)\n\n[School in Session](http://tpsnews.ca/blogs/2017/04/school-session/)\u00a0( [tpsnews.ca](http://tpsnews.ca/), April 4, 2017)\n\n[Empowering Community](http://tpsnews.ca/stories/2016/12/empowering-community/)\u00a0( [tpsnews.ca](http://tpsnews.ca/), December 13, 2016)\n\n[TPS launches program that helps civilians learn about policing](http://sharenews.com/tps-launches-program-that-helps-civilians-learn-about-policing/)\u00a0( [sharenews.com](http://sharenews.com/), October 26, 2016)\n\n[Public Goes to Police College](http://tpsnews.ca/stories/2016/10/public-goes-police-college/)\u00a0( [tpsnews.ca](http://tpsnews.ca/), October 25, 2016)\n\n## Resources\n\n### Hate the Hate -- Report the Crime\n\n[Download File](/files/download/1652806519/43125/)\n\nPlease note that some documents might not render correctly in your browser.\nFor best experience, download/save the document to your desktop first.\n\n\n## Contact Community Partnerships and Engagement Unit\n\n416-808-0100\n\n40 College St., Toronto ON\n\nM5G 2J3\n\n\n\n![Location of the contact address on the map](/static/images/maps/40_college.jpg)",

Businesses can utilize height strips at doorways and\nposition cameras at 6ft heights to capture facial features of suspects.\nStore CCTV Store footage for at least 60 days, preferably 90 days.\nClearly define rules for the usage of changing rooms and returns.\nConduct receipt checks and monitor exits.\nAdjust staffing based on risk analysis.\nDisplay surveillance signs outside the building.\n\n\n\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E P A G E 0 5\n\nInstall a security alarm system.\nUse a time-delayed safe and place decals on exterior facing windows to\nindicate the program is in place at the location.\nRemove all cash from the registers after close and lock it in a safe or make a\ndeposit.\nLeave visible cash registers empty and open at closing to show potential\nperpetrators that there is nothing in them.\nEnsure a minimum of two staff members are on shift at all times to deter\ncriminal activity.\nLock all doors and windows after closing or when they are not in use.\nEnsure there are no items surrounding the building that may be used to gain\naccess.\nAssign individuals to do an end of day check to ensure locks on windows and\ndoors are secure.\nAssign regular checks of lights, security systems, and CCTV cameras to a\ndesignated individual.\nTreat external windows with a commercial grade film that prevents breakage.\nPlace gift cards by cashiers or behind a counter within the store that is\naccessible only to store employees.\nPlace Point of Sale (POS) terminals and Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs)\nwithin 20 feet of cashiers, visible to CCTV, well-lit, and change passwords\nregularly.\nManagers or trained staff should inspect POS terminals and ATMs for\ntampering and verify gift card inventory before each shift.\nInstall security stands or place security cables on each POS pinpad.\nEnsure that there are no obstructions placed in front of gift card stands, POS\nterminals, or ATMs for employees or CCTV cameras.\nDevelop training for all staff covering evacuation procedures, including\nemergency exits and muster points.\nConduct evacuation drills regularly to familiarize staff with procedures and\nimprove response times. Ensure records are kept.\nImplement policies to ensure all staff receive training in lockdown\nprocedures including proactive measures, response protocols,\ncommunication strategies, and post-lockdown actions.\nProvide specialized training for fire wardens, loss prevention, health & safety\nspecialists, and security teams on evacuation and lockdown procedures.\n\n\n\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E P A G E 0 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR E S P O N S I B L I T I E S U N D E R O C C U P A T I O N A L\nH E A L T H A N D S A F E T Y A C T\n\nUnder the Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA), due diligence is a critical\nconcept that places the responsibility on employers to take every reasonable\nprecaution to protect the health and safety of their workers. This obligation can\nbe demonstrated by the preparation of a health and safety policy and the\ndevelopment of a health and safety program to implement that policy.\n\nDeveloping a comprehensive crime and violence prevention program in\naccordance with the OHSA is essential for promoting a safe and secure\nworkplace environment.\n\nThis guide provides you with tools to help you meet your obligations under the\nOHSA.\n\nS T R A T E G I C D A T A C O L L E C T I O N A N D A N A L Y S I S\n\nThe most effective and efficient approach(s) to preventing and addressing retail\nsafety issues are the result of strategic and sustained efforts regarding the\ncollection and analysis of relevant information. To this end, retailers should:\n\nClearly define what is classified an incident and establish incident categories.\nDevelop a standardized incident reporting tool that collects at minimum the\ndate, time, description of the incident including the perpetrator, and notes\nabout what worked and what did not regarding prevention measures,\npolicies, and/or training.\nAssign a specific individual(s) with recording incidents to ensure consistency\nin the collection and storing of the information.\nUse an easy to access software program to record incidents that could be a\nsimple spreadsheet program or a tailored and sophisticated software\nprogram. However, ensure that proper steps are taken to secure the data\ncollected.\nFinally, establish a regular interval of time to review and analyze all collected\ninformation for trends and patterns to inform the development/modification\nof policies, procedures, training, and resources for preventing and\naddressing retail safety issues.\n\nM A N A G E M E N T\nG U I D E\n\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E P A G E 0 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe key responsibilities outlined in the Occupational Health and Safety Act\n(OHSA) concerning workplace violence and harassment are as follows:\n\n Ensure workplace violence and harassment policies have been established.\n Conduct a workplace violence risk assessment or re-assessment.\n Ensure that workplace violence and workplace harassment programs are\ndeveloped and maintained to implement the policies.\n Train workers on the workplace violence and harassment policy and\nprogram.\n Subject to some conditions, the employer must provide information to a\nworker related to the risk of workplace violence from a person with a history\nof violent behaviour.\n\nPolicies and procedures help provide a framework that improves clarity for staff\non how to address retail safety issues as well as standardize approaches and\nbehaviour. Regarding retail safety issues, it is important to:\n\nDevelop and Implement a Violence Prevention Policy: Establishing a clear\nand comprehensive violence prevention policy is crucial for setting the tone\nfor safety in the workplace. This policy should outline expectations,\nprocedures for reporting incidents, and measures for preventing violence.\n\nImplement Hiring Policies: Including reference, criminal background, and\ncredit checks as part of the hiring process helps screen potential employees\nfor any red flags that may indicate a risk of violent behavior. This can\ncontribute to a safer work environment.\n\nUtilize Safe Scheduling Practices: Implementing scheduling practices that\nensure no workers are left alone during high-risk shifts for retail criminal\nactivity can help mitigate potential risks to employee safety.\n\nAssign Specific Individuals for Risk Assessments: Designating individuals\nresponsible for conducting risk assessments ensures that potential hazards\nare identified and addressed proactively.\nM A N A G E M E N T\nG U I D E\nP O L I C Y A N D P R O G R A M D E V E L O P M E N T\n\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E P A G E 0 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerform Regular Risk Assessments: Conducting regular risk assessments\nof workplace violence is crucial for identifying and addressing potential\nrisks and hazards. Employers should reassess the risks as often as\nnecessary to ensure that policies and programs continue to effectively\nprotect workers from workplace violence. The JHSC or Health and Safety\nRepresentative (HSR) must be advised of the results of the workplace\nviolence risk assessment and be provided with a written copy of the\nassessment.\n\nProvide Training in De-escalation Techniques: Training all staff, including\nspecialized staff such as loss prevention officers (LPOs), in de-escalation\ntechniques is essential for effectively managing and diffusing potentially\nvolatile situations.\n\nConduct Debriefing Sessions After Incidents: Establishing a practice of\nconducting debriefing sessions with staff after complex or difficult\nscenarios allows for reflection and continuous learning, enhancing\nemployees' ability to respond to future incidents effectively.\n\nEnsure Clear Rules and Procedures: Having clear rules and procedures\nregarding changing rooms, return policies, and checking receipts as\ncustomers leave the store helps maintain order and security within the\nretail environment.\n\n\n\nM A N A G E M E N T\nG U I D E\n\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E P A G E 0 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) can be used, in\naddition to the implementation of policies and procedures, to reduce or\neliminate the potential for workplace violence. These measures involve:\n\n\nNatural Surveillance: focuses on designing spaces to maximize visibility and\nobservation. By removing obstructions, improving lighting, and strategically\nplacing surveillance cameras, employees and customers can feel safer\nknowing that their surroundings are easily observable.\n\nNatural Access Control: involves controlling the movement of people within a\nspace to create a perception of risk for potential offenders. Elements such as\nwell-defined entrances and exits, fencing, and landscaping can deter criminal\nactivity by making it more difficult for unauthorized individuals to access the\npremises.\n\nTerritorial Reinforcement: promotes a sense of ownership among employees\nand customers by clearly defining ownership of space through signage and\nregular maintenance. This sense of ownership can reduce the likelihood of\ncriminal activity as individuals are more likely to take pride in and protect\nspaces they perceive as their own.\n\n Implementing these CPTED principles, along with comprehensive policies and\npractices for workplace violence and harassment prevention, contributes to a\nculture of safety and security in retail settings. Ultimately, these measures\naim to promote employee well-being and reduce the risk of criminal activity,\ncreating a safer and more productive work environment for all.\n\n(See Appendix A for CPTED checklist for Businesses)\n\nM A N A G E M E N T\nG U I D E\nC R I M E\nP R E V E N T I O N\nT H R O U G H\nE N V I R O N M E N T A L\nD E S I G N\n( C P T E D )\n\n\nT Y P E S O F I N C I D E N T S\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ROBBERY\n BREAK AND ENTER\n FRAUD\n SHOPLIFTING\n SUSPICIOUS INDIVIDUAL\n INTOXICATED PERSON\n EVACUATION\n LOCKDOWN/ACTIVE ATTACKER\n SUSPICIOUS PACKAGE\n BOMB THREAT\n\n\n\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E P A G E 1 0\n\n\n\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E P A G E 1 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to robberies, some studies have found that a lack of training and\ninexperienced staff members may contribute to higher victimization rates. As a\nresult, proper training that includes theoretical and scenario-based training for\nstaff is a valuable investment to reduce the potential injury of staff.\n\nTopics covered in the chosen training should include how to respond during a\nrobbery as well as what the roles and responsibilities are of staff, management,\nand loss prevention officers or private security.\n\n\nM A N A G E M E N T A N D C O R P O R A T E P O L I C I E S\n\nPut policies and procedures in place to help establish and reinforce safety\nmeasures. For instance, it is a generally accepted practice to have at least two\nstaff members on shift at all times to help deter a robbery or other criminal\nactivity. Depending on the size of the business, an individual should be made\nresponsible to regularly check the building to ensure all of the lights, security\nsystem, and CCTV cameras are operational.\n\n\n\n\n\nROBBERY\n\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E P A G E 1 2\n\n\nA F T E R T H E I N C I D E N T\nAs soon as the perpetrator has left the building:\n\n Lock the door to the business and\ndo not allow anyone in until the police arrive.\n Call 911.\n Write down everything that you remember about the perpetrator.\n If there are witnesses, ask them to stay to make a statement for the police or\nprovide you with their contact information to provide to police.\n Ensure that no one touches or tampers with any potential evidence (i.e.,\nanything the perpetrator touched).\n If applicable, contact your businesses loss prevention staff and/or\nmanagement.\n\nFollowing the incident, a debriefing session should be scheduled with the staff\ninvolved. The purpose of the debriefing session is to improve prevention and\nfuture responses as well as answer questions and support the staff member(s)\ninvolved. A debriefing session is not meant to find fault or establish blame.\nCorporate procedures should be established that specify when these sessions\nshould be held with the staff member(s).\n\nThe duration of the debriefing session will vary depending on a variety of\nfactors: the severity of the incident; the impacts felt by the staff member(s)\ninvolved; and the time required by management to review existing policies and\nprocedures and assess if there are ways to improve the response and prevent\nfurther incidents.\n\nDuring the session, policies and procedures should be reviewed and input about\nchallenges and possible opportunities for improvement should be welcomed and\nrecorded. It is important to note that a debriefing session should be made\navailable to all staff that were impacted by the incident, which could include\nwitnesses and direct victims.\n\nFollowing the debriefing session, all staff members should be made aware of the\nsteps taken to address the incident and any applicable policy changes or\nnew/updated measures being implemented (i.e., a CCTV camera or training for\nstaff).\n\n\n\n\nDOCUMENTATION\n\nTo aid in this process, a Retail Crime Problem Solving Assessment and Crime\nPrevention Through Environmental Design checklist should be complete\n(Appendix E and Appendix A).\n\n\nRetail stores can be particularly vulnerable to \u201csmash and grab\u201d thefts whereby\nperpetrators simply smash an available window to quickly enter the store and\ngrab accessible merchandise.\n\nTo safeguard against break and enter:\n\nTreat windows with a commercial grade film that makes them very difficult to\nbreach. The use of bars should be carefully evaluated and used when the\nsituation calls for it, such as in high crime areas. Bars on windows and doors\nvisually reinforce to lawful customers the store has a crime problem, possibly\nreducing comfort levels of customers to shop there.\nPost on doors/window that: an alarm company monitors the premises, and\nno money is kept onsite. Include the local police non-emergency number to\ncall, if a witness sees something non-urgent yet out of place/suspicious.\nKeep some lighting on inside the building to help with video surveillance\nquality and enable witnessing of activity, and consider placing lights on\ntimers, if possible, to simulate activity.\nRemove anything on the exterior which could be used to gain entry to your\npremises (bricks, ladders, poles, construction materials).\nEnsure backs of businesses are clear and free of debris and do not allow for\nstacked items (such as refuse containers, boxes, etc.) to remain that can be\nclimbed upon to gain access to the roof or can be easily set on fire.\nEnsure all doors and windows are properly locked and secured during\nregular business hours and afterwards.\nOnce the business has closed, remove all cash from tills, leave the cash tray\nopen and visibly empty. Also remove all valuables from visible storefront\ndisplays.\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E\nP A G E 1 3\n\n\nBREAK AND ENTER\n\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E P A G E 1 4\n\nM A N A G E M E N T A N D C O R P O R A T E P O L I C I E S\n\nPut policies and procedures in place to ensure individuals are responsible for\nverifying that all windows and doors are locked at closing time, that there are no\nmaterials left close by the business that could be used to break-in and that cash\nregisters are emptied and left open after closing the store if they are situated by\na window that is visible from the street. After hours, all POS terminals are to be\nsecurely stored out of site.\nA F T E R T H E I N C I D E N T\n\nAfter confirming that a break-in has occurred: Assign one individual to handle\nthe following process from start to finish:\n\n File a police report\n Make an insurance claim\n Schedule any repairs and cleanup required\n Complete a retail crime problem solving assessment as well as a Crime\nPrevention Through Environmental Design checklist to identify what\nhappened, an approach to address the issue, and ways to prevent the\nincident in the future.\n\nAssuming that no staff member is present during a break and enter, a debriefing\nsession should be scheduled with management and loss prevention officers. The\npurpose of the debriefing session will be to determine if all policies and\nprocedures were followed and then begin the process to establish ways to\nprevent the occurrence from happening in the future. The session also serves to\nanswer questions and support the staff member(s) involved. A debriefing\nsession is not meant to find fault or establish blame. During the session, policies\nand procedures should be reviewed and input about challenges and possible\nopportunities for improvement should be welcomed and recorded.\nThe outcomes of the debriefing session should be shared with staff members to\noutline what happened, what was taken and/or damaged, how the individuals\nentered the building, and any applicable policy/procedural changes to prevent\nsimilar incidents in future (i.e., a CCTV camera or training for staff).\nDOCUMENTATION\n\nTo aid in this process, a Retail Crime Problem Solving Assessment and Crime\nPrevention Through Environmental Design checklists should be completed\n(Appendix E and Appendix A).\n\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E P A G E 1 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFraud is defined as one who, by deceit, falsehood, or other fraudulent means,\ndefrauds the public or any person of any property, money or valuable security\nor any service.\n\nIt\u2019s important to ensure staff are trained to spot counterfeit bills/cheques, gift\ncard fraud, and credit card/debit fraud. Knowledge and scenario-based training\nis preferable with photos of real examples being easily referenced by staff\nduring their shifts at each cash register.\n\nTo safeguard against fraud:\n Place gift cards by cashiers or behind a counter within the store that is\naccessible only to store employees.\n Situate POS terminals as well as Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs) close to\ncashiers or other workstations (no more than 20 feet away), in a sightline of a\nCCTV camera, and in a highly visible part of the store that is well lit.\n Only operate chip enabled POS terminals.\n Install security stands or place security cables on each POS terminal.\n Ensure that there are no obstructions placed in front of gift card stands, POS\nterminals, or ATMs for employees or CCTV cameras.\n\nM A N A G E M E N T A N D C O R P O R A T E P O L I C I E S\nPrior to the beginning of each shift, managers or a trained staff member should\ninspect all POS machines as well as ATMs in the store for any signs of tampering.\nAdditionally, gift card inventory should be checked to ensure \u201cfake\u201d gift cards\nhave not been placed on the stand. Put policies in place to reinforce these\npreventative measures.\n\n\n\n\nFRAUD\n\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E P A G E 1 6\n\nA F T E R T H E I N C I D E N T\nAcknowledging the different types of frauds that may occur, the following are standard\nsteps to take following all incidents:\n\n Complete a report identifying all relevant information of the transaction\nusing Appendix D and Appendix E. All potential evidence should be covered\n(i.e., POS machine) or placed in a secure area of the business (i.e., gift card)\nfor police.\n For repeat offenders or incidents, consider submitting the information\ncollected to Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre to help with statistical\ninformation and the investigation of fraud.\n Support services should be offered to staff members that have been\nnegatively impacted by the situation.\n Staff members should be debriefed on the situation regarding lessons\nlearned and any changes in policies/procedures.\n\nDOCUMENTATION\n\nComplete a report identifying all relevant information of the transaction using Appendix\nD and Appendix E.\n\n\nIn order to proactively reduce the threat of theft, employees should be trained to\nrecognize behaviours that are most associated with shoplifting, however, no behaviour\nis confirmation that shoplifting will occur. Most common behaviours include:\n\nSelecting multiple goods quickly and without looking at prices.\nWearing bulky clothing items, especially when it does not match the season (i.e.,\nhaving a winter coat on during warm weather).\nCustomers carrying large bags or backpacks.\nIndividuals looking around at the ceiling for cameras, watching staff or hanging\naround particular parts of the store near high value or high theft items.\nPerson(s) frequently visiting the store and not making purchase(s).\n\nSHOPLIFTING\n\nindividuals that they are on camera.\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E P A G E 1 7\n\nTraining staff to focus on behaviors rather than individual characteristics is\nessential for promoting a fair and inclusive workplace environment.\nDiscrimination based on personal attributes such as race, ethnicity, age, gender,\nsexual orientation, or disability is not only unethical but also illegal under the\nOntario Human Rights Code.\n\nEducating employees to approach situations with a customer service mindset\nrather than resorting to physical confrontation is not only beneficial for the\nsafety of both employees and customers but also aligns with best practices in\nconflict resolution. For instance, staff should be trained to offer their assistance\nto individuals suspected of shoplifting, make an offer for the individual to pay\nfor the items they may have placed in their pockets or backpack.\n\nBy adopting a customer service approach focused on identifying higher-risk\nbehavior, staff can effectively deter shoplifting and minimize the likelihood of\nconfrontations or incidents. Providing comprehensive training and ongoing\nsupport will empower staff to handle situations confidently and professionally\nwhile promoting a positive and safe shopping environment for all.\nMANAGEMENT AND CORPORATE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES\n\nPut policies and procedures in place to clearly outline and implement\npreventative measures to deter shoplifting. For example, there should be\nclear policies and procedures for changing rooms, clear return policies\n(requiring the original receipt), and procedures to check receipts as\ncustomers leave the store.\nEnsure staffing levels are highest during high-risk times for shoplifting based\non an analysis of incidents at the store.\nAssign two staff members to manage the sale and security of the topmost\nstolen items.\nPlace the topmost stolen items within five to 20 feet of a workstation, in the\nsightline of a visible CCTV camera in a well-lit area with signs reminding\n\n\n\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E P A G E 1 8\n\nFocusing efforts on specific techniques can effectively reduce the incidence of\nshoplifting, which is often driven by opportunity. Here are some key techniques\nto consider:\n\nDisplay more expensive further into the store, away from any exit/entrance.\nThis will deter shoplifters and make them more conspicuous.\nLock high value/high risk products away and display empty boxes on the\nsales floor.\nEnsure shelving throughout the store does not create any blind spots for\nemployees or CCTV cameras.\nKeep storefront windows clear of obstructions to permit informal\nsurveillance of the sidewalk/street/mall from inside the business and out.\nTwo-way observability and transparency can create visual interest, activity,\nand safety. Avoid placing large posters or having excessive frosting/tinting of\nstorefront windows that block sightlines.\nPost on doors/windows signs that an alarm company monitors the premises,\nand that no money is kept onsite. Include the local police non-emergency\nnumber to call, if not urgent thus avoiding a 9-1-1 call should any witness\nnotice a break-in or damage has occurred.\nInstall a CCTV system for your business and its immediate physical\nsurroundings. Images captured are an effective tool used by police that\ngreatly increase both suspect apprehension and the probability of a crime\ngetting solved. Ensure sufficient lighting to maximize image quality. It is\nequally important to use higher resolution cameras and have a minimum\nimage retention/storage period of at least 30 days, with 90 days being the\nrecommendation.\nInside the store, camera placement should not be limited to overhead\ninstallations. This is because many criminals pull hoods or other clothing\nitems over their heads to try and avoid facial capture of their image. If\nadditional cameras are discreetly installed at counter height and pointed up\nslightly, the suspect\u2019s face is more likely to be recorded, increasing the\nprobability of arrest by police.\nConsider a CCTV surveillance system which can both be monitored remotely\nby phone/online and record images to review for an investigation.\nBusinesses with customer waiting areas should use seating that looks both\nout of the business and within while waiting. This ongoing, random\nmonitoring makes criminals feel less confident about taking unlawful action.\n\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E P A G E 1 9\n\n\n\nAFTER THE INCIDENT\n\nIf an individual is confirmed to have taken an item either by observation of a\nstaff member or from the CCTV, the following are possible actions that may be\ntaken:\n\n Report the incident to the police non-emergency line or through online\nreporting to ensure that they are able to record the incident and add it to\ntheir criminal statistics to improve analysis or aid ongoing investigations.\n\nThe frequency of shoplifting, potential danger in apprehending/detaining\nperpetrators, and investment to build a prosecution case may influence a\nbusiness in choosing to call the police.\n\nConsidering these factors, the following criteria are examples to help Loss\nPrevention personnel decide on shoplifting instances that can be reported\nonline or called in without a police officer having to respond and attend on site:\n\n Theft is under $500.\n Identification of the Suspect is not a factor.\n The Suspect is 12 years of age or older.\n There was no violence or fear of violence encountered during arrest.\n The Suspect is not displaying signs of being intoxicated by alcohol or drugs.\n The theft is not part of an organized theft ring.\n Multiple Suspects are not involved.\n Language is not a barrier.\n There are no other unusual circumstances involved.\n The Suspect does not request Police involvement.\n\nThis approach provides an expedited solution for loss prevention officers,\nremoving the need to detain perpetrators on the premises. Furthermore, this\ntype of approach enables police officers to focus on repeat or organized retail\ncriminals.\n\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E P A G E 2 0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is crucial to emphasize that suspicion should never be based on factors such\nas race, ethnicity, colour, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, sex, marital\nstatus, disability, or appearance. Discrimination of any form is not only unethical\nbut also illegal under the Ontario Human Rights Code, which ensures equal\ntreatment for all individuals accessing services, goods, and facilities.\n\nInstead, it's essential to train staff to recognize behaviors or actions that may\nraise legitimate concerns about potential theft or other misconduct, regardless\nof the individual's demographic characteristics. These behaviors might include\nbut are not limited to:\n\n Blood shot eyes, excessive sweating, or pacing in a particular area of the\nstore.\n Asking questions that go beyond merchandise and curiosity such as asking\nabout shift changes, personnel, security procedures, etc.\n Paying unusual attention to the activities of employees, looking for security\ncameras, exits.\n Video recording.\n Putting a large amount of high value items into their shopping cart or basket,\nwithout taking time to look at price or the item(s).\n Loitering outside the store or close to the cash registers without purchasing\nany items from the store.\n\nTraining in de-escalation techniques, and unconscious biases will provide staff\nmembers with the tools to effectively address suspicious individuals. Specifically,\nde-escalation training will provide staff with a set of tools to address the\nsituation in a non-confrontational manner. Stereotypes based on different types\nof unconscious biases such as first impressions, extrapolating one\npositive/negative interaction as indicative of every interaction or\napproval/support of people who are similar to us etc. can lead to making\njudgements which could result in unfounded accusations of minorities or\nindividuals from vulnerable populations.\n\nAdditionally, tools such as active listening can also be used to resolve conflict.\nThis communication skill can be used to absorb information and reflect it\n(through questions and body language) back to the speaker that you heard\nthem.\n\nSUSPICIOUS\nINDIVIDUAL\n\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E P A G E 2 1\n\nMANAGEMENT AND CORPORATE POLICIES\n\nPolicies and procedures should be in place that ensure all staff receive training\nin de-escalation techniques with augmented training (i.e., mental health first aid\ntraining) for specialized staff such as loss prevention officers. According to those\npolicies and procedures, management should ensure staff receive the training\nrequired and are provided the opportunities to have debriefing sessions while\non the job and in a comfortable environment.\n\n\nAFTER THE INCIDENT\n\nFollowing the identification of a suspicious person, fill in a report to keep a\nrecord on file for other employees and hold debriefing sessions with staff after\ncomplex/difficult scenarios to help ensure there is an opportunity to continue to\nlearn and improve on the skills acquired from training.\n\n\nDOCUMENTATION\n\nComplete a report identifying the suspicious person and keep this record on file\nfor other employees to refer to. Completion of a report will help to identify\npatterns or specific individuals that are perceived to be suspicious by multiple\nemployees. The information from these reports may also provide beneficial\ninformation for investigations into more serious matters such as shoplifting or\nother types of retail crime. Ensure Date/Time and description of a suspicious\nperson or activity is archived and flagged. Suspicious incidents may occur weeks\nprior to an actual robbery and video retention will be very important.\n\n\n\n\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E P A G E 2 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn intoxicated person is someone that is under the influence of drugs, alcohol,\nor any other intoxicant.\n\nTraining employees will help to ensure the safety of staff, customers, and the\nintoxicated person. Specifically, active listening and de-escalation training will\nprovide staff with a set of tools to address the situation in a non-confrontational\nmanner. The ultimate goal of de-escalation is to avoid physical confrontation and\nachieve a peaceful resolution for the individuals involved.\n\nRecognizing signs of impending escalation of violence is important. These\nwarning signs include:\n\n Fidgeting\n Tapping on the desk\n Pacing\n Crossed arms\n Dismissive communication\n Rude/offensive language\n Raised voice\n Rapid breathing\n Face reddening\n Cursing\n Tone of voice\n Name calling\n Clenched fist/jaw\n Waving objects\n Threats of violence\n Finger pointing\n Yelling\n\nDe-escalation training will provide staff with the tools to address this situation in\na safe and non-threatening manner.\n\n\nINTOXICATED PERSON\n\n\n\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E P A G E 2 3\n\nM A N A G E M E N T A N D C O R P O R A T E P O L I C I E S\n\nPolicies should be in place that ensure all staff receive training in de-escalation\ntechniques with augmented training (i.e., medical health first aid training) for\nspecialized staff such as loss prevention officers. These policies should also\nspecify debriefing sessions with staff after complex/difficult incidents to help\nensure there is an opportunity to continue to learn and improve on the skills\nacquired from training. According to those policies, management should ensure\nthat staff receive the training required and are provided the opportunities to\nhave debriefing sessions while on the job and in a comfortable environment.\n\nAFTER THE INCIDENT\n\nDepending on the outcome of the incident, there will be different options\navailable:\n\n Make a police report if someone was injured or property was damaged.\nVictim services are available through local police services as well as workers\ncompensation boards for victims as well as witnesses of crimes.\n Request medical support or counselling for instances involving injury.\n Complete a debriefing session with a colleague or manager to review what\nhappened, what worked well, and what could be improved upon next time.\n\nThe purpose of the debriefing session is to improve prevention and responses in\nthe future. These sessions are a way to answer questions and support the staff\nmember(s) involved. The purpose of any debriefing session is not to find fault or\nestablish blame. During the session, policies should be reviewed and input\nabout challenges and possible opportunities for improvement should be\nrecorded.\n\nFollowing the debriefing session with the staff members involved in the incident\n(i.e., witnesses as well as direct victims), all staff members should be made\naware of the steps taken to address the incident and any applicable policy\nchanges or measures being implemented (i.e., a CCTV camera or training for\nstaff).\n\n\n\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E P A G E 2 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are many reasons that may cause a location to have to be evacuated.\nTraining in emergency preparedness is critical to ensure that everyone can exit a\nfacility as directly and safely as possible.\n\nM A N A G E M E N T A N D C O R P O R A T E P O L I C I E S\nPolicies should be in place that ensure all staff receive training in evacuation\nprocess, locations of emergency exits, location of muster point and augmented\ntraining for specialized staff such as fire wardens, health & safety specialists and\nsecurity teams. These policies should also specify evacuation drills and\ndebriefing sessions with staff to help ensure there is an opportunity to continue\nto learn and improve on the time it takes to safely evacuate a facility. According\nto those policies, management should ensure that staff receive the training\nrequired.\n\nAFTER THE INCIDENT\n\nFollowing an evacuation, fill in a report to keep a record on file for time to\nevacuate, issues arising and corrective actions taken. Management should\nengage in post-event assessments and activities, including:\n\n-An accounting of all individuals at a designated assembly point to\ndetermine who, if anyone, is missing and potentially injured.\n\nDOCUMENTATION\n\nA full and thorough report should be done once the emergency is over. The\nreport will provide a format for recording the sequence of events during an\nactual or practice emergency evacuation and action table to identify\nimprovements.\n\n\n\n\n\nEVACUATION\n\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E P A G E 2 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLockdown is a word used in response to a major incident or threat of violence\nwithin a building or in relation to that building. RUN, HIDE, DEFEND are the\nactions taken during a lockdown.\n\nThere are different types of incidents that will trigger a lockdown and it is\nimportant to be trained in the various types of lockdown procedures, such as,\nbut not limited to: mall takeovers and crowd control situations, active attacker,\netc.\n\nAn active attacker is a(n) individual(s) actively engaged in killing or attempting to\nkill people in a confined and populated area; in most cases, active attackers use\nfirearms and there is no pattern or method to their selection of victims.\n\nActive attacker situations are unpredictable and evolve quickly. Typically, the\nimmediate deployment of law enforcement is required to stop the threat and\nmitigate harm to victims. Knowing what to do can save lives.\n\nLockdown and Active Attacker is commonly used to describe the same situation\nand it is important to recognize that although a lockdown may be involved when\nthere is an active attacker, there are may other reasons where a lockdown can\ntake place and responding to an Active Attacker situation requires additional\ntraining. Businesses should ensure they have training for Active Attacker and\ninvolve experts to develop the training.\n\nThe evacuation of an area or facility may involve the consultation of emergency\nresponse units or outside experts.\n\n\n\n\nLOCKDOWN/ACTIVE\nATTACKER\n\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E P A G E 2 6\n\nM A N A G E M E N T A N D C O R P O R A T E P O L I C I E S\n\nPolicies and procedures should be in place that ensure all staff receive training\nin lockdown/active attacker procedures and augmented training for specialized\nstaff such as loss prevention, health & safety specialists, and security teams.\nThese procedures should also specify tabletop drills and debriefing sessions be\npracticed with staff to help ensure there is an opportunity to continue to learn\nand improve. Employees and customers are likely to follow the lead of\nmanagers, loss prevention and security during an emergency. During an\nemergency, managers, Loss Prevention and Security should be familiar with their\nEmergency Response Plan, and be prepared to take immediate action, remain\ncalm, lock and barricade doors, evacuate staff and customers via a preplanned\nevacuation route to a safe area, if safe to do so.\n\n(Management should refer to the employee section when responding to a\nLockdown/Active Attacker)\n\n\nDURING THE INCIDENT\n\nIf you or staff have the opportunity, run away from the attacker. If the attacker\nstands between you and the exit, move to safety, and hide. Make it difficult for\nthe attacker to see or hear you. If you are in a group, split up. If you find yourself\nface to face with the attacker, defend yourself by any means necessary.\n\n(Management should refer to the employee section on run/hide/defend, when\nresponding to a Lockdown/Active Attacker)\n\n\n\n\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E P A G E 2 7\n\nAFTER THE INCIDENT\n\nAfter the active shooter has been incapacitated and is no longer a threat, and/or\na lock-down has been lifted, management should engage in post-event\nassessments and activities, including:\n\n Accounting for all individuals at a designated assembly point to determine\nwhom, if anyone is missing and potentially injured.\n Contact emergency services for anyone who appears to be in distress or\ninjured.\n Identifying and filling any critical personnel or operational gaps left in the\norganization because of the active attacker.\n Set up a Command Centre. This should be a central communication post.\nAssign a Crisis Lead.\n Determining a method for notifying families of individuals affected by the\nactive shooter, including notification of any casualties.\n An Employee Assistance Program (EAP) should be made available and\nmembers should be encouraged and supported to participate in the\nprogram.\n Direct any media inquiries to senior management within the location or\ncorporate office.\n\n\nDOCUMENTATION\n\nFollowing a lockdown, complete a report to keep a record on file, review the\nreport with the appropriate people who support and respond to emergencies\nand address any issues arising and corrective actions taken.\n\n\n\n\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E P A G E 2 8\n\n\n\nSUSPICIOUS PACKAGE\n\nA suspicious package can come in almost any form:\n\n-an unidentified package received at a worksite;\n-a suspicious object left in a public area; a social media post;\n-a text or email message;\n-a handwritten note, memo, or letter;\n-or even written words on a wall.\n\nIt is very important to have all bomb threats investigated by police. Due to the\nextreme seriousness of a suspicious package, action must be taken swiftly and\nimmediately.\n\nMANAGEMENT AND CORPORATE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES\n\nPolicies and procedures should be in place that ensure all staff receive training\non how to respond to a suspicious package. Suspicious Package Investigations\nare required when an actual suspicious item is found. When this occurs\nmanagement/security will initially investigate the item and if determined to be\nsuspicious in nature notify police. Suspicious Package Investigations may require\nan evacuation of the entire or a portion of the facility. Safe mustering areas\nneed to be pre identified for employees and evacuation routes. Standardized\nmessaging should be developed to deliver to employees when an investigation is\ncommenced and if an evacuation is required.\n\nAccording to those policies and procedures, management should ensure staff\nare trained and are provided the opportunities to have debriefing sessions while\non the job and in a comfortable environment. These procedures should also\nspecify tabletop drills and debriefing sessions with staff to help ensure there is\nan opportunity to continue to learn and practice how to respond to such\nsituations.\n\nAFTER THE INCIDENT\n\nFollowing a suspicious package investigation, fill in a report to keep a record on file for\nother employees and hold debriefing sessions with staff after complex/difficult\nscenarios to help ensure there is an opportunity to continue to learn and improve on\nthe skills acquired from training.\n\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E P A G E 2 9\n\nDOCUMENTATION\n\nComplete a report that includes all the details surrounding the incident and\nkeep this record on file for other employees to refer to.

This places a significant obligation on employers to\nproactively identify and mitigate workplace hazards and risks including\nworkplace violence.\n\nUpon encountering violence in the workplace workers are responsible under the\nOHSA to report any contravention of the Act or regulations, or the presence of\nany hazards they are aware of, to their employer or supervisor. This obligation\nencompasses incidents of workplace violence, such as those mentioned in the\nfollowing examples:\n\n Verbally threatening to harm a worker or their family, friends, associates, or\nproperty.\n Making physical contact with a worker or attempting to do so (e.g., hitting,\nshoving, blocking, etc.).\n Sending threatening notes/emails to a worker.\n Throwing objects or shaking a fist at a worker.\n\nAccording to the OHSA, workplace violence is defined as:\n\n The exercise of physical force by a person against a worker, in a workplace,\nthat causes or could cause physical injury to the worker.\n An attempt to exercise physical force against a worker, in a workplace, that\ncould cause physical injury to the worker.\n A statement or behavior that it is reasonable for a worker to interpret as a\nthreat to exercise physical force against the worker, in a workplace, that\ncould cause physical injury to the worker.\n\nBy reporting such incidents promptly, workers contribute to maintaining a safe\nand secure work environment, in accordance with the requirements of the\nOHSA.\n\nWorkers have the right to refuse unsafe work as outlined in the OHSA. If a\nworker believes that performing a task or working in a particular environment\nposes a danger to their health and safety, they have the right to refuse to work\nuntil the situation is remedied.\n\nP A G E 3 4\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E\n\nWorkers have the right to refuse unsafe work as outlined in the OHSA. If a\nworker believes that performing a task or working in a particular environment\nposes a danger to their health and safety, they have the right to refuse to work\nuntil the situation is remedied.\n\nThe right to refuse unsafe work also extends to situations involving violence or\nthe risk of violence in the workplace. Workers have the right to refuse work if\nthey believe it poses a danger to their health and safety, including the threat of\nviolence from clients, customers, co-workers, or others.\n\nThe Employee Guide outlines the best practices to implement during the\nfollowing incidents:\n\nRobbery\nBreak and Enter\nFraud\nShoplifting\nSuspicious Individual\nIntoxicated Person\nEvacuation\nLockdown/Active Attacker\nSuspicious Package\nBomb Threat\n\n\n\n\nP A G E 3 5\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDURING THE INCIDENT\n\nIf a robbery is in progress, the best option is to take steps to limit the amount of time\nthat the perpetrator is in the store and to reduce the exposure of staff members to the\nthreat. To achieve this objective, the following courses of action are suggested:\n\n Remain Calm: to the best of your ability. Ensure that you do not make any sudden\nmovements and assure the perpetrator that you will cooperate with them and listen\nto their instructions.\n Follow Instructions: do not argue with the perpetrator. Only provide them with what\nthey are asking you to provide.\n Put Your Personal Safety First: do not engage physically with the perpetrator. Do\nnot chase after the perpetrator following the incident.\n\nTake Mental Notes: during the incident, be aware of:\n\nThe number of perpetrators.\nApproximate weight, height, age, hair and eye colour, build.\nGender.\nAny distinguishing features (i.e., tattoos, scars, piercings, clothing).\nWhat they touched.\nLicense plate number of car they arrived/left in.\nDirection the perpetrator(s) left in.\n\n\n\n\n\nROBBERY\n\nP A G E 3 6\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E\n\n\n\nBREAK AND ENTER\n\nDURING THE INCIDENT\n\nBased on the Canadian Criminal Code, a distinguishing feature of a break and\nenter compared to a robbery is that a break and enter may occur after hours,\nwhen staff are not present. While both break and enter and robbery involve\ntheft, robbery uses violence or threats against a person or property resulting in\na more serious and violent offense (and resultant punishment) than a break and\nenter. Generally, perpetrators will commit a break and enter offense when they\nare least likely to be caught (i.e., when there are no people around to witness\nthe crime). However, if you are in the area when a break and enter occurs, the\nfollowing courses of action are suggested:\n\nPut Your Personal Safety First: do not engage physically with the perpetrator,\nand do not chase after the perpetrator. Alternatively, find a safe place (i.e., a\nroom with a lockable door) and stay there until police arrive.\nOnce in a safe place, call 911.\nIf you see the perpetrator, take physical/mental notes of:\nThe number of perpetrators (i.e., if you hear conversations between multiple\nindividuals).\nApproximate weight, height, age, hair and eye colour, build (i.e., skinny,\nmuscular, overweight).\nGender\nAny distinguishing features (i.e., tattoos, scars, piercings, clothing).\nWhere the perpetrators were in the business during the incident.\nLicense plate number of car they arrived/left in.\nDirection they left in.\n\n\n\n\nP A G E 3 7\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E\n\nIf your store location has a security alarm system, and the alarm has triggered a\npolice or private security response when no other staff members are present do\nnot enter the building. Wait until the arrival of police or security. If you witness\nanyone leaving the building, call 9-1-1 with the information above.\n\nFrom the perspective of staff safety, it is preferable if a break and enter occurs\nwhen no one is in the business and a security alarm is triggered to alert police or\na private security service to respond as quickly as possible.\n\nHowever, if a security alarm is not installed or it was not triggered during the\nbreak and enter, then you as a staff member may be the first on scene.\n\nIf you are the first to arrive at the business and notice that it has been broken\ninto, do not enter the store, or leave the store if you believe the perpetrator(s)\nmay still be inside. Call the police to report the incident noting that you believe\nthe perpetrator is still in the building. If you do not believe that the perpetrator\nis still in the store, then call the non-emergency line for the police to report the\nincident.\n\n\n\n\nP A G E 3 8\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDURING THE INCIDENT\n\nThe best way to address any type of fraud is to take a customer service\napproach. The reason for this approach is that victims may commit fraud\nunknowingly. For example, someone may not know that they were provided with\ncounterfeit bills or are purchasing gift cards on behalf of a perpetrator. As a\nresult, it is important to avoid accusations as much as possible and instead focus\non being polite and alert. However, if at any time the perpetrator becomes\nviolent or threatens you or other staff members with violence then call 911\nimmediately.\n\nBelow you will find ways to address each type of fraud.\n\nCounterfeit bills/cheques: increasing electronic and card payments as well as\nincreasing security features for Canadian bills have been associated with a\nreduction in these types of fraud. Regardless, these types of fraud still occur,\nand the following are suggestions for how to address the incident.\n\nTo spot a counterfeit bill:\n\nRun the tip of your finger along the \u201cBank of Canada/Banque du Canada\u201d on\nthe front of the bill, as they should be raised.\nTilt the bill underneath a light and look for multiple colours reflecting in the\nsee-through portion of the bill.\nThe see-through portion of the bill should also have the monetary\ndenomination of the bill alternating between facing the front and back of the\nbill as well as growing larger from the top of the bill to the bottom.\nDifferent bills will have different historical figures from Canada\u2019s past on\nthem. Although, every bill will have the individual\u2019s face reflected in the top\nright portion of the see-through part of the bill.\n\n\n\n\nFRAUD\n\nP A G E 3 9\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E\n\nIf you suspect someone has provided you with a counterfeit bill:\n\n Politely and kindly, inform the individual that you have reviewed the bill(s)\nand there are some features that lead you to believe that it may be\ncounterfeit. After explaining why, politely refuse to accept the bill(s) in\nquestion.\n Ask the customer to make a payment for their purchase using another\nmethod or other bill(s) that should go through the same inspection process\nas you did with the first bill(s).\n Regardless of you being able to complete the transaction inform the\nindividual that they should go to their local police service department to\ncheck the bill(s) that were provided.\n\nTo spot a fraudulent cheque:\n\n Ensure that the cheque is filled in completely, has preprinted information on\nit regarding the financial institution, and does not show signs of alteration.\n Review the back of the cheque provided to you, as it will disclose the specific\nsecurity features for that cheque.\n The amount of the cheque should match the price of the item being\npurchased. There is something called an \u201coverpayment scam\u201d when a\nperpetrator writes a cheque for an amount higher than the purchase price\nand then requests a refund.\n For money orders and bank drafts that are suspicious, you may call the\nissuing bank to verify its authenticity.\n\nIf you suspect someone has provided you with a counterfeit cheque:\n\nIt is best to have information on the individual providing the cheque before\naccepting it (i.e., a client file with contact information including their\naddress). Additionally, you should only provide the item that is being\npurchased once the cheque has cleared.\nPolitely and kindly, inform the individual that you have reviewed the cheque\nand there are some features that lead you to believe that it may be\ncounterfeit. After explaining why, politely refuse to accept the cheque in\nquestion.\nAsk the customer to make a payment for their purchase using another method of\npayment.\n\n\n\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E P A G E 4 0\n\n\n\nGift card fraud\n\nIncreasingly, gift card fraud is becoming more prevalent as a target of crime\nitself (i.e., placing fake gift cards on store shelves) as well as part of other frauds\n(i.e., CRA telephone scam). The reason for this is that gift cards are easily\nliquidated by criminals into legitimate forms of cash.\n\nTo prevent gift card fraud, the following steps are suggested:\n\nIf a customer is buying a large amount of gift cards, kindly and in a non-\nconfrontational or accusatory way, ask the purpose of purchasing the gift\ncards. In some cases, fraudsters will be instructing an individual to purchase\nthe gift cards on their behalf. This is known as Victim Assisted gift card fraud.\nCashiers need to inspect all gift cards purchased to ensure the packing has\nnot been tampered with and that it is a legitimate gift card. Specifically, make\nsure there are no spelling mistakes, fuzzy graphics, broken seals, or bar\ncodes/PINs that have been tampered with.\nCashiers should ensure that the gift card being purchased is reflected in the\nPOS machine (i.e., an Amazon gift card is identified as an Amazon gift card). If\na fraudulent gift card is being purchased, then the POS system will not\nrecognize the proper gift card. Another check would be to confirm\n\u201csuccessful activation\u201d on the receipt.\nCashiers should not accept payment for gift cards by a customer that is using\na credit card or debit card that does not have a chip and PIN option or the\nchip and PIN functions are not working if they are present on the card.\nAll employees should be aware of fraudulent phone calls from individuals\nclaiming to be from a gift card provider or an IT company that asks them to\nactivate gift cards as a test. These companies will not make requests like this,\nand employees should be made aware that they are indications of an\nattempted fraud.\n\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E P A G E 4 1\n\n\n\nCredit card debit fraud\n\nThe implementation of chip technology for debit and credit cards has made\npositive impacts on reducing the number of debit and credit card related fraud\nat the point of sale. With that said, the following steps are available to help\nprevent credit card and debit fraud:\n\n Purchase a POS terminal that has a chip reader.\n Do not accept payments from individuals using debit or credit cards that do\nnot have a chip and PIN option or the chip and PIN options are not working if\nthey are present on the card.\n\nIncidents of online order and pick-up fraud have increased in recent years. This\nis a process in which individuals are able to buy a product online and then pick\nthe item up in-store. To address this issue, the following steps should be\nconsidered:\n\nIf financially viable, consider purchasing an online fraud management\nsystem. Alternatively, or to augment the online fraud management system,\nmanually review online orders involving high-value or a high-volume of items.\nIf manually monitoring online sale orders, be cautious when:\n\n A high number of orders from the same billing address, payment\ninformation, and/or email address is placed in a short period.\n If the location of pick-up is changed from previous orders with the same\nbilling address, payment information, and/or email address.\n If the billing address and email have different payment information.\n\nRecord and track phone numbers, email addresses, billing information, and\npayment information, and IP addresses that are associated with problematic\ntransactions in the past.\nIf the online payment system allows, flag customers that use multiple credit\ncards before having a payment approved and show limited browsing time on\nthe site (i.e., did they just get on and order a high volume of high-risk\nproducts or did they search the site, look at reviews, and compare prices of\nitems).\nHave an application available for customers to use to notify when their\npackage is available for pickup and when a customer has arrived to pick-up\ntheir purchase.\n\n\n\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E P A G E 4 2\n\n Ensure the pickup area is well lit and has CCTV cameras.\n Train employees to lockup purchases in a secure room prior to pick-up and\nensure the contents match the purchase order before providing to the\ncustomer.\n At the time of pick-up, make sure the information provided matches the\nbilling information. If not, request that the purchase be made in-store at a\nPOS terminal.\n\nPOS terminal(s):\n\nPerpetrators may tamper with a business\u2019s POS terminal(s) by installing devices\nthat can read credit/debit card information including Personal Identification\nNumbers (PINs) or cameras to record this information. To prevent his type of\nfraud, the following steps are suggested:\n\nInspect POS terminals at the beginning and end of every shift to verify that\nthey have not been tampered with. Look for things like, missing screws,\ncracks, and any new holes in addition to verifying the serial number of the\nmachine.\nLook for cameras or unauthorized recording devices in and around the POS\nterminal.\n\n\n\n\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E P A G E 4 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to the potential risk to staff and customers, staff members should not\nphysically engage or confront/accuse alleged shoplifters. With that said, it is\nimportant to note that to be caught shoplifting the individual has to take\nsomething from the store and bypass an opportunity to pay for the item. As a\nresult, just because someone took something off the shelf and put it into their\npocket does not mean that they have shoplifted. Accusing someone of\nshoplifting runs the risk of a physical confrontation. Therefore, if you believe\nsomeone is shoplifting, the following approach is recommended:\n\n Approach the customer in a friendly manner and ask if they want a flyer or if\nyou could help them find something, they need on sale. If they do not have a\nbasket or shopping cart, offer one to them to use while they shop.\n While you are talking with the individual make note of the following:\n-approximate weight, height, age, hair and eye colour, build,\n-any distinguishing features (i.e., tattoos, scars, piercings, clothing).\n If they decline all of your assistance, inform them where all of the checkout\ncounters are in the store and that the lines are short right now. This can be a\nsimple reminder to the customer to pay for their items on their way out.\n If the CCTV camera system is capable, the individual may also be monitored\nby video as they shop to verify:\n-what they look like and if they operated alone or in a group\n-how they entered the store (i.e., if by car, record the license plate)\n-what items they took, method they used to leave the store with the\nitems\n-how they exited the store with the item(s).\n\nAll of this information will be helpful for investigating and hopefully catching the\nperpetrator as well as establish how to prevent a similar incident from\nhappening in the future.\n\nIf at any time, the perpetrator becomes violent or threatens staff members with\nviolence, call 911 immediately.\n\n\nSHOPLIFTING\nDURING THE INCIDENT\n\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E P A G E 4 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDURING THE INCIDENT\n\nIf a suspicious person has been identified, the following steps are suggested:\n\n Always keep your personal safety in mind \u2013 this means do not argue/accuse,\nthreaten physically engage with the individual or prevent them from leaving\nthe store.\n Offer customer service assistance to a suspicious person as you would any\nnormal customer. Doing this right up front can prevent an incident from\noccurring and a situation from escalating.\n Maintain six feet between you and the individual using physical barriers such\nas counters and display cases to ensure a safe distance.\n If you can, take note of the following pieces of information:\n\n-the number of individuals,\n-length of time in the business,\n-approximate weight, height, age, hair and eye colour, build,\n-any distinguishing features (i.e., tattoos, scars, piercings, clothing),\n-where the individual(s) were in the business.\n\nIf you feel there is a threat of violence then contact your manager, loss\nprevention officers, private security or colleagues if there are no other options.\nUpon contacting one or more of individual(s), begin the conversation by\ndescribing the scenario and the individual, how long they have been in the store,\nand what is making you concerned about the individual. Ensure the\nDate/Time/Description of the suspicious person is flagged and archived on video\nsurveillance. Incidents may occurred weeks prior to a robbery and video\nretention will be very important.\n\n\nSUSPICIOUS INDIVIDUAL\n\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E P A G E 4 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDURING THE INCIDENT\n\nIf an individual enters the store and is suspected of being intoxicated, the\nfollowing steps are suggested:\n\nApproach the individual with open body language (i.e., in a non-\nconfrontational way) and speak in a calm manner with a low tone of voice.\nIntroduce yourself and let the individual know what position you have at the\nstore.\nAlways maintain at least six feet between you and the individual.\nAsk for their name and tell them what you see (i.e., they look upset or that\nthey are yelling).\nTell the individual that you are there to help them and reassure them that\nyou do not want to argue or debate with them if they are verbally\nconfrontational.\nUse active listening to understand what the individual is going through and\nhow you can help them. Primarily this is accomplished by reflecting on what\nthe individual is saying to you by paraphrasing and asking them if you\nunderstand them correctly.\nWhen speaking with the individual remember to be simple, clear, and focus\non building a rapport.\nBe aware of the physical space around you. For example, ask the intoxicated\nindividual to move away from others being mindful as to not block an exit for\nthem and using counters or furniture/ displays to keep as a barrier between\nyou and the individual.\nAfter speaking with them, the individual may decide on their own to leave the\nstore. If not, ask if there is a family/friend that can come help them, call a\ncommunity service that offers help to individuals under the influence, or if\nyou ever feel threatened or at-risk of violence then call 911 immediately.\n\n\n\nINTOXICATED PERSON\n\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E P A G E 4 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDURING THE INCIDENT\n\nFollow the directions from the emergency services.\nMake an announcement that the building is being evacuated and direct\neveryone to the nearest exit.\nIf fire wardens are not pre-determined, all managers (and coordinators as\nneeded) will be the fire wardens.\nHead to the external assembly area; advise all staff and contractors of the\nclosest emergency exit and ask them to come with you.\nCheck in with your manager or fire warden upon arrival to the assembly area.\nOnly if safe to do so, management/fire wardens/security should conduct a\nsweep of the facility to ensure all contractors, employees and visitors have\nexited the building.\nComplete a head count of all employees, contractors and notify fire\nwarden/management.\nProvide the location of rooms/areas that are used in the building to provide\n\u201cShelter in Place\u201d to the emergency services when they arrive on site.\nHR / Management on site shall communicate any employees who they\nanticipate could use the shelter in place location during an evacuation, (i.e.,\nmodified work restrictions, disability, etc).\nThe facility will not re-open until authorities have deemed it appropriate to\ndo so and given the all clear.\nComplete an Evacuation Report and save it for future review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEVACUATION\n\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E P A G E 4 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify the type of emergency response plans you are facing. There are three\nemergency response plans:\n\n1\\. Shelter in place: Generally, an environmental threat (i.e., flood) is present\noutside and it is not possible or advisable to evacuate the store. Provide the\nlocation of shelter in place rooms/areas to the police. HR / Management on site\nshall communicate to any employees who they anticipate could use the shelter\nin place location during an emergency (i.e., modified work restrictions, disability,\netc.).\n\n2\\. Hold and secure: Ensure the door(s) leading to the outside of the building are\nlocked and people may not exit or enter the building. This is a partial lock down\nfor danger due to physical / environmental threat outside the store. In case of a\nfire, ensure there is the ability to exit the building.\n\n3\\. Lockdown: Lockdown is a word used in response to a major incident or threat\nof violence within a building or in relation to that building. RUN/HIDE/DEFEND\nare the actions taken during a lockdown.\n\nDURING THE INCIDENT\n\nAssess the situation- Determine the most reasonable way to keep yourself\nsafe. Workers are most likely to follow the lead of management during an active\nattacker situation. Do not endanger your safety or the safety of others. Actions\nneed to be based on ongoing assessments and actions are not always fixed, they\nmay change if the situation requires new and immediate action. Remember, an\nenvironmental concern is quite different from a violent offender in the\nimmediate area.\n\nReact - Determine the location of the attacker(s) (inside or outside store). Based\non your assessment, react to the situation at hand in the safest possible method\nfor you and those around you. There may be danger from the gunfire of the\nattacker and responding police officers. You must decide which action to take:\nRUN/HIDE/DEFEND.\n\nRun - If it is safe to do so and you have an accessible escape path, leave the\nlocation you are in, moving away from the area of risk.\n Go away from the sound of the shooting.\n\nLOCKDOWN/ACTIVE\nATTACKER\n\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E P A G E 4 8\n\n Exit quickly but cautiously and do not waste time trying to gather your\nbelongings.\n Evacuate regardless of whether others agree to follow.\n Help others escape, if possible.\n Get to an area of safety outside and prevent others from entering the area of\nrisk.\n Keep your hands open and visible.\n Show police your hands and listen for commands.\n Offer any information you can \u2013 description, location of attacker, number of\nattackers, type(s) of weapons, etc.\n Follow the police officers\u2019 instructions.\n\nHIDE - First make sure there is no safe way out. If you do not have a safe way out\nof your location, then find the closest area where you can hide out and\nbarricade yourself and others. If possible, choose a room that you can lock and\nbarricade in place (such as offices and utility rooms).\n Remain quiet, turn off lights and silence cell phones.\n Listen for attacker\u2019s progression.\n Look for items you can use to fight for your life, if necessary.\n Calm hysterical people to keep them quiet.\n Hide behind large, solid items.\n Dial 911, if possible and safe to do so, if you cannot speak leave the line open\nto allow the dispatcher to listen.\n\nDEFEND - As a last resort, and only when your life is in imminent danger, attempt\nto disrupt and/or incapacitate the active attacker. Here are some ways to do\nthis:\n Act as aggressively as possible against the attacker.\n Have as many people as willing and rush the shooter en masse and attack\nrelentlessly.\n Don\u2019t stop until the attacker is down and incapacitated.\n Secure the incapacitated attacker with whatever you have.\n Commit to your actions.\n Continue to listen to ensure there aren\u2019t other attackers.\n\nREACTING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT ARRIVAL\n\nRemain calm and follow officers\u2019 instructions.\nPut down any items in your hands.\nRaise empty hands and spread fingers.\nKeep hands visible at all times.\n\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E P A G E 4 9\n\n Avoid making quick movements toward officers such as attempting to hold on to\nthem for safety.\n Avoid pointing, screaming and/or yelling.\n Do not stop to ask officers for help or direction when evacuating, just proceed in\nthe direction from which officers are entering the premises.\n Provide as much detail as you can to police, like:\n-location of the attacker, number of attackers, physical description,\n-type of weapons held by the attacker, number of potential victims.\n The first police officers on scene will not stop to help injured persons.\n Rescue teams comprised of additional officers and emergency medical personnel\nwill follow the initial officers. These rescue teams will treat and remove any injured\npersons. They may also call upon able-bodied individuals to assist in removing the\nwounded from the premises.\n\nOnce you have reached a safe location, do not leave until law enforcement authorities\nhave instructed you to do so.\n(See Appendix I for Run, Hide, Defend poster below)\n\n\n\n\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E P A G E 5 0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDURING THE INCIDENT\n\nIf you are the one receiving the bomb threat, document all the details and note\nany of the following:\n\n Pitch of the caller\u2019s voice.\n Any accent or distinctive features of their voice.\n Any background noises (traffic, subway, bells, kids, indoor vs outdoors).\n The specifics of the threat including any location/time/reason.\n What is the number on the call display? Write it down.\n\nDo not try to determine if the threat is a hoax or real, treat it as a real\nemergency. Report the incident to security and/or 9-1-1.\n\nIf you discover a suspicious item, do not touch it. Notify security immediately, or\n9-1-1 if your business does not have security on site. Do not use any electronic\ndevice, cell phone or walkie talkie in close proximity of the item.\n\nIf an evacuation is ordered, follow your business evacuation plan/route, and\ncontinuously scan your surroundings until safely at the evacuation site. Avoid\nstanding in front of windows or other potentially hazardous areas. Do not block\nthe sidewalks or roadway \u2013 keep clear for emergency services.\n\nIf an explosive incidents occurs, follow established evacuation procedures and\ncall 9-1-1.\n\n\n\n\nBOMB THREAT/SUSPICIOUS\nPACKAGE\n\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E P A G E 5 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following techniques can be used when dealing with people in a retail\nenvironment:\n\nACTIVE LISTENING\n\nEffective communication involves both a speaker and a receiver. In order for the\nmessage to be understood, the participants must take into account more than\njust talking. Active listening is feedback given by the listener to convey their\ninterest in what the speaker has to say. This will provide them with the\nopportunity to understand, interpret, and evaluate what the speaker is telling\nthem.\n\nActive listening involves being genuine, engaged, and empathetic. This can be\nconveyed by using the following techniques:\n\n Make eye contact \u2013 be focused but do not stare. Be cognizant that in certain\ncultures, excessive eye contact can be seen as aggressive or rude.\n Minimize distractions and focus on the speaker. Do not check your phone for\ne-mails or texts.\n Avoid interrupting the speaker. Focus on the person and do not listen with\nthe goal of responding to (fixing) the problem.\n Welcome pauses. Some people may need additional time to think about what\nthey are saying.\n Ask questions. Clarifying what is said in a friendly and non-judgmental way\nwill let the speaker know that you are listening and interested.\n Paraphrase the information in order to avoid misperceptions by allowing the\nspeaker to correct any misunderstandings.\n Take time to analyze what is being said.\n Look at the body language of the speaker to determine how they feel about\nwhat they are talking about e.g. gestures, posture, facial expressions etc.\n Use a relaxed posture with unclenched hands and an attentive facial\nexpression.\n Give the person physical space \u2013 approximately 2 to 4 feet for most cultures.\n Get on the person\u2019s physical level (e.g. if they are seated, kneel or bend to\ntalk to them rather than standing up).\n Do not make sudden movements as these can seem threatening.\n\nBy using active listening effective communication can be achieved and reduce\nthe chance of miscommunication or aggressive responses.\n\n\nHELPFUL TIPS\n\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E P A G E 5 2\n\nCONFLICT RESOLUTION\n\nConflict can arise in workplace situations due to lack of communication, lack of\ncontrol over the situation, personality clashes and/or issues outside of the retail\nenvironment. Conflict resolution is a strategy used to alleviate tension between\npeople.\n\nConflict in the workplace can be resolved in the following ways:\n\n Allow people to talk and express their frustrations until they calm down.\n Validate their feelings by using empathy statements such as \u201cI understand\u201d or\n\u201cI see\u201d.\n Be aware of your tone e.g. don\u2019t smile or mock the other person.\n Be neutral (i.e. do not agree or disagree with the other person or provide\nyour opinion).\n Do not react with a similar angry response.\n Help the person to focus on the issue rather than become tangential.\nRedirect the conversation back to the issue at hand.\n Avoid making conflicts public. If possible, try to have the conversation away\nfrom other people.\n Find something to agree about in order to foster collaboration and\ncooperation.\n Listen to what the person has to say without interrupting. When the person\nhas stopped talking you can summarize their main points and work\ncollaboratively on a solution.\n\nDE-ESCALATION\nWorkplace violence can take many forms such as:\n Yelling.\n Intimidating actions.\n Waving objects.\n Rude/offensive language.\n Cursing.\n Raised voice.\n Threats of violence.\n Name calling.\n Finger pointing.\n Aggressive tone of voice.\n\n\n\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E P A G E 5 3\n\nIt's important to recognize the signs of potential escalation in a workplace\ninteraction to prevent violence. Here's a breakdown of the typical sequence of\nevents and some de-escalation strategies:\n\n Early warning signs: These can include non-verbal cues like fidgeting,\npacing, or crossed arms, as well as verbal cues like dismissive or rude\nlanguage. When you notice these signs, remain calm and try to defuse the\nsituation by actively listening and showing empathy. Avoid responding\ndefensively or confrontationally.\n Hostile behaviour: Signs of hostility may include a raised voice, rapid\nbreathing, or rude/offensive language. In response, maintain a calm\ndemeanor and speak in a calm, respectful tone. Acknowledge the person's\nfeelings and concerns without agreeing with any aggressive or inappropriate\nbehavior.\n Threatening behaviours: If the situation escalates to threatening behavior\nsuch as clenched fists, yelling, or intimidating gestures, prioritize safety.\nMaintain a safe distance and avoid making sudden movements that could\nfurther agitate the individual. Try to diffuse tension by remaining calm and\nexpressing a desire to resolve the issue peacefully.\n Assaultive behaviour: If the situation escalates to physical violence or\nassaultive behaviour, prioritize your safety and the safety of others. Remove\nyourself from the immediate vicinity if possible and seek assistance from\nsecurity or law enforcement if necessary.\n\nIn all stages of escalation, it's crucial to avoid trading insults, taking the situation\npersonally, speaking condescendingly, physically touching the person, or\npreventing them from leaving. These actions can escalate the situation further\nand increase the risk of violence.\n\nFor additional tips on preventing workplace violence and de-escalating tense\nsituations visit the wsps.ca.\n\n\n\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E P A G E 5 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTogether, 37 Ontario Crime Stoppers Programs are working to keep Ontario safe.\n\nThe Ontario Association of Crime Stoppers, as well as all local Ontario Crime\nStoppers programs, use a highly secure online web portal called \"P3 Tips\". The\nonline submission method allows you to upload videos, audio files and photos\nthat can greatly enhance the value, accuracy and usefulness of your tip. At the\nend of the online submission process, you will be given a unique TIP ID number\nand password that identifies your tip. This ID number can be used for future\ninquires to check on the status of your tip or add additional details that may\ncome to mind. By providing information that Crime Stoppers will share with law\nenforcement agencies, you are providing an important and valuable public\nservice. If your tip leads to an arrest or recovery of drugs or stolen property, you\nmay be eligible for a reward up to $2,000.00. To learn more about the program\nvisit www.ontariocrimestoppers.ca.\n\nThe Ontario Association of Crime Stoppers works with other Crime Stoppers\nprograms on a national and international level as it represents Ontario at the\nCanadian Crime Stoppers Association and Crime Stoppers International. Every\ntime anonymous information is provided to the program, another opportunity is\ncreated to solve a crime which provides the community a chance to reclaim its\nneighbourhood from criminality and violence.\n\nYour community matters and we would like to hear from you. Remember, you\nremain anonymous and criminals don\u2019t. If you would like to file an Anonymous\nCrime Stoppers Information Report, please call 1-800-222-8477 (TIPS) or visit,\nwww.ontariocrimestoppers.ca/submit-a-tip.\n\n\n\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E P A G E 5 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that these responses are not to be considered legal\nadvice nor a suitable replacement for professional advice provided by a lawyer.\n\nCan a staff member grab an individual? The Criminal Code of Canada does\nallow for any individual to make a citizen\u2019s arrest. However, this option is not\nrecommended due to the risk to staff members.\n\nCan a staff member ask to look in someone\u2019s bag? Businesses are allowed to\nask to look into someone's bag and/or set their own policies regarding the\npractice. However, an individual can decline the request and leave the store\nas they do not have to allow any person to search their property without a\nsearch warrant.\n\nWhat are the legal implications of accusing and/or chasing a perpetrator? After a\nsuspected individual of a retail crime leaves the store and they are chased by\nan employee, then it is a separate incident. For example, if a staff member\nchases a perpetrator after that person robbed the store and is assaulted,\nthen there is one incident of robbery and separate incident of assault.\nAlternatively, if a staff member is deemed to have used excessive force on\nthe perpetrator after chasing them, then they may be charged with assault.\nDue to the potential risk and for the safety of employees, it is not\nrecommended that an employee accused and/or chase an individual\nsuspected of a retail crime.\n\nHow long and under what conditions are staff able to detail someone suspected\nof committing a retail crime? Properly trained staff (i.e., loss prevention\nofficers) may detain a perpetrator after an offence has occurred with reason.\nHowever, detaining an individual safely requires tools (i.e., handcuffs) as well\nas physical space (i.e., a secure room). As staff injured are most likely occur\nonce a perpetrator has been detained or held in a secure room waiting for\npolice to arrive - and the wait times for police may take several hours -\ndetaining an individual suspected of committing a retail crime is not a\npreferred option.\n\nCan businesses post a photo of someone confirmed or allegedly to have\ncommitted a retail crime? A business may post photos from their own\nsurveillance system in their business with no perceived liability issues.\nHowever, there is little to no research indicating that this is an effective\npractice or deterring or reducing retail criminal incidents.\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED\nQUESTIONS\n\nR E T A I L S A F E T Y A N D S E C U R I T Y G U I D E P A G E 5 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION, CONSULT THE FOLLOWING RESOURCES:\n\nRunyan, C., M.

While many of the 151 recommendations suggest systemic changes relating to missing person investigations, one recommendation indicated that the Service should conduct Missing Person Awareness Days.\n\nSo, February 3, 2024 marks the inaugural Toronto Police Service Missing Person Awareness Day. February 3 was chosen in consultation with our Missing and Missed Implementation Community Representatives, in part, because it coincides with National Missing Person Day, which is held on February 3 each year in the United States.\n\n##### Guide to Missing Person Reporting\n\nThis guide designed to empower our community with valuable information on the process of reporting missing persons, offering guidance on assisting in their location, dispelling common myths, and providing additional resources.\n\n##### **The Missing Persons Unit**\n\nThe Missing Persons Unit oversees missing persons cases and unidentified human remains occurrences from all over the city of Toronto.
