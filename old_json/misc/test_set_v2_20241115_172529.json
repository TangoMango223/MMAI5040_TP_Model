Keep motion sensor lights functional and consider adding window bars or security film.\n  - **Warning Signs to Watch For:** Signs of tampering on locks or windows. Suspicious individuals casing the area.\n  - **Immediate Actions to Take:** If you suspect a break-in, do not enter the property. Call the police immediately and wait for their arrival.\n  - **Available Community Resources:** Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) principles can help, such as ensuring visibility and access control.
