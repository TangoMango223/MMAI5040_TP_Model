However, residential break-ins can occur at any time, especially when homes appear unoccupied.\n\n2. TARGETED SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n- Assault: Consider enrolling in a self-defense course and always be aware of your surroundings. If you witness an assault, call 911 immediately. The Toronto Police Service also has victim services available for support. \n- Auto Theft: Ensure that your vehicle is always locked, even when parked at home, and avoid leaving valuables in the car. If your vehicle is stolen, report it to the police immediately. \n- Break and Enter: Continue using your home security system and outdoor cameras. Regularly check that they are functioning properly.
