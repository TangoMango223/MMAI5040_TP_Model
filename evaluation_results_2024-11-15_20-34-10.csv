3. PERSONAL SAFETY PROTOCOL:

- Daily Safety Habits: Be aware of your surroundings, especially when walking alone at night. Follow the City of Toronto's personal safety checklist to enhance personal safety practices.
- Essential Safety Tools: Carry a personal alarm or whistle, have your phone readily available, and consider a personal safety app.

            CITY OF TORONTO SERVICE SAFETY PLAN
            Neighbourhood: Etobicoke City Centre (159)
            Primary Concerns: Auto Theft: low, Robbery: medium, Assault: high, Break and Enter: low

            1. NEIGHBOURHOOD-SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT:

Etobicoke City Centre has a high level of assault and a medium level of robbery, with lower levels of auto theft and break-ins. The high level of assault may be related to the operating hours of local businesses, as deserted streets can provide opportunities for crime. The medium level of robbery might be influenced by the availability of targets, such as unattended properties or individuals. Extra caution should be exercised during late hours when local businesses are closed and streets are less populated.

2. TARGETED SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS:

- Assault: Prevention strategies include staying in well-lit areas, avoiding deserted streets, and travelling in groups when possible. Warning signs could include suspicious individuals or groups, particularly in isolated areas. If encountered, try to leave the area and contact the Toronto Police immediately. The Toronto Community Crisis Service and Community Crisis Response are available for support.

- Robbery: Prevention strategies include being aware of your surroundings, not displaying valuable items in public, and securing your property. Warning signs could include suspicious individuals observing you or your property. If encountered, do not resist and contact the Toronto Police as soon as it is safe to do so. The neighborhood watch program can be a valuable resource.

- Auto Theft: Prevention strategies include parking in well-lit areas, locking your vehicle, and not leaving valuables in sight. Warning signs could include suspicious individuals loitering near parked cars. If your car is stolen, report it to the Toronto Police and the Collision Reporting Centres immediately.

- Break and Enter: Prevention strategies include securing doors and windows, installing security systems, and not leaving spare keys outside. Warning signs could include suspicious individuals loitering near homes. If a break-in occurs, do not enter your home and contact the Toronto Police immediately.

3. PERSONAL SAFETY PROTOCOL:

Develop daily safety habits such as being aware of your surroundings, securing your property, and staying informed about local safety issues. Essential safety tools could include a personal alarm, a flashlight, and a charged mobile phone. In case of emergencies, contact the Toronto Police at 911. The Toronto Community Crisis Service and Community Crisis Response are also available for support. Attend community meetings to stay informed and participate in the neighborhood watch program.

4. PREVENTIVE MEASURES:

Secure your home with locks on doors and windows, and consider installing a security system. For personal safety, consider using a personal alarm or a safety app on your mobile phone. Engage with your community by attending community meetings and participating in the neighborhood watch program. Report any suspicious activities to the Toronto Police at their non-emergency line: 416-808-2222.

Remember, while there are safety concerns in Etobicoke City Centre, there are also various resources and strategies available to mitigate these concerns. By staying vigilant, informed, and proactive, you can contribute to the safety of your community.

            CITY OF TORONTO SERVICE SAFETY PLAN
            Neighbourhood: St.Andrew-Windfields (40)
            Primary Concerns: Break and Enter: high

            1. NEIGHBOURHOOD-SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT:

The St. Andrew-Windfields area has been experiencing a high rate of break-ins, particularly during nighttime. This suggests that burglars may be taking advantage of the cover of darkness and the likelihood that residents are asleep. The recent break-in experienced by your neighbour further highlights the need for vigilance and proactive safety measures. 

2. TARGETED SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS:

For Break and Enter:
- Prevention Strategies: Install motion sensor lights outside your property to deter burglars. Join or start a neighbourhood watch program to increase vigilance and reporting of suspicious activity. Consider using a security alarm system, which can act as a deterrent and provide immediate notification of a break-in. Mark your valuables with a Trace Identified pen as recommended by the Toronto Police.
- Warning Signs: Watch for unfamiliar vehicles or individuals loitering in the neighbourhood, especially during nighttime. Be alert to unusual noises or activities.
- Immediate Actions: If you encounter a break-in, do not confront the intruder. Call 9-1-1 immediately and wait for the police to arrive. 
- Community Resources: The Toronto Police Service provides resources for preventing break-ins. You can also reach out to your local community centre or neighbourhood association for support and resources.

3. PERSONAL SAFETY PROTOCOL:

- Daily Safety Habits: Regularly check and maintain your security systems. Be vigilant about locking doors and windows, especially at night. 
- Essential Safety Tools: Keep a fully charged phone accessible at all times for emergency calls. Consider investing in a home security system with a loud alarm and direct police notification.
- Emergency Contact Information: In case of an immediate threat, call 9-1-1. For non-emergency crimes, report to the Toronto Police at 416-808-2222.
- Community Support Services: Engage with your local community centre or neighbourhood association for support and resources.

4. PREVENTIVE MEASURES:

- Home/Property Security Recommendations: Reinforce all entry points, including doors and windows. Install security cameras at key points around your property. 
- Personal Safety Technology Suggestions: Consider installing a home security system with a loud alarm and direct police notification. Use a Trace Identified pen to mark your valuables.
- Community Engagement Opportunities: Join or start a neighbourhood watch program. Attend community safety meetings and stay informed about local crime trends.
- Reporting Procedures and Important Contacts: Report any suspicious activity to the Toronto Police at 416-808-2222. Keep a list of important contacts, including the local police station, community centre, and neighbourhood association.

Remember, your safety is paramount. Always prioritize your personal safety over protecting property. If you need more specific guidance, please contact the Toronto Police Service's non-emergency line at 416-808-2222.

            Neighbourhood: Downtown Yonge East (168)
            Primary Concerns: Break and Enter: low, Robbery: medium, Assault: high, Auto Theft: medium

            1. NEIGHBOURHOOD-SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT:

Downtown Yonge East (168) has been identified as an area with high levels of assault, medium levels of robbery and auto theft, and low levels of break and enter. These crimes can be interrelated, and areas with high levels of one type of crime often have high levels of others. Environmental factors such as poor lighting, lack of people, and the physical layout of the area can increase the risk of these crimes. As a resident, you are exposed to these risks daily. 

Specific areas or times that require extra caution are poorly lit areas, secluded areas, and times when there are fewer people around, such as late at night or early in the morning. 

2. TARGETED SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS:

For Assault:
- Prevention Strategies: Stay in well-lit, populated areas whenever possible. Avoid walking alone at night. 
- Warning Signs: Suspicious individuals or groups, particularly if they are behaving aggressively or erratically.
- Immediate Actions: If you feel threatened, call 911 immediately. Try to get to a safe, populated area.
- Community Resources: Toronto Police Service, local community centres, and neighbourhood watch programs.

For Robbery:
- Prevention Strategies: Be aware of your surroundings, especially in secluded or poorly lit areas. Avoid displaying valuable items in public.
- Warning Signs: Individuals following you or acting suspiciously.
- Immediate Actions: If you are being robbed, prioritize your safety. Hand over your belongings and call 911 as soon as it is safe to do so.
- Community Resources: Toronto Police Service, local community centres, and neighbourhood watch programs.

For Auto Theft:
- Prevention Strategies: Always lock your vehicle and park in well-lit, busy areas. Consider investing in a car alarm or tracking device.
- Warning Signs: Broken glass or signs of forced entry.
- Immediate Actions: If your vehicle is stolen, report it to the police immediately.
- Community Resources: Toronto Police Service, local community centres, and neighbourhood watch programs.

3. PERSONAL SAFETY PROTOCOL:

- Daily Safety Habits: Stay vigilant and aware of your surroundings. Avoid walking alone at night and stay in well-lit, populated areas whenever possible.
- Essential Safety Tools: Consider using personal safety devices and apps. Keep your phone charged and accessible.
- Emergency Contact Information: Toronto Police Service (911 for emergencies, 416-808-2222 for non-emergencies), local community centres, and neighbourhood watch programs.
- Community Support Services: Local community centres often offer safety workshops and resources. Neighbourhood watch programs can also be a valuable source of support and information.

4. PREVENTIVE MEASURES:

- Home/Property Security: Continue using security cameras at home. Consider additional measures such as improved lighting and secure locks.
- Personal Safety Technology: Consider using personal safety apps that can alert authorities or trusted contacts if you are in danger.
- Community Engagement: Get involved in community safety initiatives, such as neighbourhood watch programs. This can help improve overall community safety and foster a sense of connection among residents.
- Reporting Procedures: Report any suspicious activity to the Toronto Police Service. In an emergency, call 911. For non-emergencies, call 416-808-2222.

Remember, your safety is paramount. Always trust your instincts and take proactive steps to protect yourself and your property. Stay informed about the safety concerns in your area and the resources available to you.
