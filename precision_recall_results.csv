Identification numbers may be altered or removed, ownership certificates forged, parts sold or the vehicle repainted\n- For transportation - Thieves will use your vehicle to get where they want to go and later abandon the vehicle. They may just drive it around to gain ‘status’ with their friends\n- To commit other crimes - Vehicles are stolen and used in other crimes such as robberies, break and enters, drug dealing or drive-by shootings\n- For vehicle cloning - Vehicles are stolen, given a fraudulent identification number and then sold to unsuspecting persons who are defrauded of their money.
