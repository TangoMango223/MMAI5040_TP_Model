- Immediate Actions: If you encounter a threatening situation, call 9-1-1 immediately. If you can do so safely, move to a well-lit, populated area.
- Community Resources: The Community Violence Wellness and Recovery Project offers support for individuals and communities impacted by violence. 

3. PERSONAL SAFETY PROTOCOL:

- Daily Safety Habits: Stay alert and aware of your surroundings, especially in identified high-risk areas. Keep your phone charged and accessible. 
- Essential Safety Tools: Keep the contact information of the Toronto Police and your safe contact readily available. Consider carrying a personal alarm or whistle.
- Emergency Contact Information: Toronto Police can be contacted in emergencies via 9-1-1, or for non-emergencies at 416-808-2222. Crime can also be reported anonymously through Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477(TIPS) or online at www.222tips.com.
- Community Support Services: The Community Violence Wellness and Recovery Project offers support for individuals and communities impacted by violence.

4. PREVENTIVE MEASURES:

- Home/Property Security: Ensure your home is well-lit and secure. Consider installing a security system or cameras.

- Warning Signs: Be aware of suspicious activity around parking areas, such as individuals loitering without apparent purpose, or unfamiliar vehicles circling the area.
- Immediate Actions: If you encounter a theft in progress, do not confront the thief. Instead, move to a safe distance and call 911. Provide as much detail as possible about the thief and the vehicle.
- Community Resources: The Toronto Police Service provides a wealth of resources on crime prevention, including tips for vehicle security. Consider organizing or joining a neighbourhood watch program to increase surveillance and report suspicious activity.

3. PERSONAL SAFETY PROTOCOL:

- Daily Safety Habits: Be vigilant about your surroundings, especially when returning home late at night. Keep your vehicle keys ready as you approach your car and check your surroundings before entering.
- Essential Safety Tools: Consider investing in a personal safety alarm and a reliable flashlight. Keep your mobile phone charged and easily accessible.
- Emergency Contact Information: In case of an emergency, call 911. For non-emergencies, contact the Toronto Police Service at (416) 808-2222.
- Community Support Services: Reach out to local community organizations for support and resources. They may offer safety workshops or community patrols.

4. PREVENTIVE MEASURES:

- Home/Property Security: Install motion-sensor lights around your property, especially near parking areas. Consider installing a home security system or surveillance cameras.
- Personal Safety Technology: Consider using a GPS tracking device for your vehicle. There are also numerous personal safety apps available that can alert loved ones or authorities if you're in danger.

            Primary Concerns: Assault: low, Break and Enter: medium

            1. NEIGHBOURHOOD-SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT:

North Riverdale is a vibrant neighbourhood in Toronto with a medium risk of break and enter incidents. While the risk of assault is low, residents should remain vigilant, especially during the evening hours. Most residential break-ins occur during the day when homes are unattended, so extra caution is advised if you return home around this time. During winter months, the risk of break-ins may increase due to longer nights providing more cover for potential burglars.

2. TARGETED SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS:

For Break and Enter:
- Prevention Strategies: Enhance your home security by upgrading your basic alarm system to a monitored one, installing security cameras at entrances, and reinforcing doors and windows. Regularly check your property for any signs of forced entry, such as damaged locks or windows.
- Warning Signs: Unusual activity in your neighbourhood, such as unfamiliar vehicles or individuals, could be potential warning signs. Also, be aware of any sudden increase in break-ins in your area.
- Immediate Actions: If you encounter a break-in, do not enter your home. Call 9-1-1 immediately and wait for the police to arrive.
- Community Resources: The Toronto Police Service offers tips on break and enter prevention. You can also consider starting or joining a neighbourhood watch program.

For Assault:
- Prevention Strategies: Stay alert when traveling through North Riverdale in the evenings. Vary your routes and times to make your patterns less predictable to potential criminals.
- Warning Signs: Aggressive behaviour or threats should be taken seriously. If you feel threatened, move to a public place and call for help.
- Immediate Actions: If you are assaulted, call 9-1-1 immediately. Try to remember as many details as possible about the assailant to assist the police.
- Community Resources: The Toronto Police Service provides general crime prevention tips.

3. PERSONAL SAFETY PROTOCOL:

- Daily Safety Habits: Stay alert and aware of your surroundings, especially when traveling in the evenings. Regularly check your home security system to ensure it's functioning properly.

- Emergency Contact Information: In case of emergencies, call 9-1-1. For non-emergencies, call the Toronto Police non-emergency line at 416-808-2222.
- Community Support Services: Connect with local community groups to stay informed about safety concerns in your area.

4. PREVENTIVE MEASURES:

- Home/Property Security: Regularly check your property for any signs of forced entry. Keep a record of your valuables and report any burnt out lights on your property.
- Personal Safety Technology: Consider installing a monitored alarm system and security cameras at your home. Use motion-sensor lights to deter potential burglars.
- Community Engagement: Engage with your neighbours and local community groups. Consider starting or joining a neighbourhood watch program.
- Reporting Procedures: Report any suspicious activity to the Toronto Police Service. In case of emergencies, call 9-1-1. For non-emergencies, call the Toronto Police non-emergency line at 416-808-2222.

            CITY OF TORONTO SERVICE SAFETY PLAN
            Neighbourhood: Bridle Path-Sunnybrook-York Mills (41)
            Primary Concerns: Assault: low, Break and Enter: high

            1. NEIGHBOURHOOD-SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT:

The Bridle Path-Sunnybrook-York Mills neighbourhood has been experiencing a high frequency of break and enter incidents. This has been causing significant concern among residents, particularly in areas with less lighting during nighttime. These areas are perceived as less safe and may be contributing to the high frequency of break-ins. The risk of break-ins is also higher during times when homes are typically unoccupied, and homes in more isolated or less visible areas may be at a higher risk.

2. TARGETED SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS:

For Break and Enter:
- Prevention Strategies: Improve home security by installing alarm systems, reinforcing doors and windows, and ensuring adequate outdoor lighting. Participate in neighbourhood watch programs and report any suspicious activity to the police.
- Warning Signs: Unfamiliar vehicles or individuals loitering in the neighbourhood, signs of forced entry such as broken windows or doors, and unusual noises.
- Immediate Actions: If you encounter a break-in, do not enter your home. Call 911 immediately and wait for the police to arrive. Do not touch anything as it may disturb potential evidence.
- Community Resources: The Toronto Police Service provides resources for break and enter prevention. Local community groups have also initiated neighbourhood watch programs.

3. PERSONAL SAFETY PROTOCOL:

- Daily Safety Habits: Keep doors and windows locked, even when you are home. Be aware of your surroundings, especially in areas with less lighting. Participate in neighbourhood watch programs.
- Essential Safety Tools: Consider installing a home security system and outdoor lighting. Keep a list of emergency contact numbers readily available.
- Emergency Contact Information: In case of an emergency, call 911. For non-emergencies, contact the Toronto Police Service at (416) 808-2222.
- Community Support Services: Participate in local community groups and neighbourhood watch programs. Utilize resources provided by the Toronto Police Service and the City of Toronto.

4. PREVENTIVE MEASURES:

- Home/Property Security Recommendations: Install alarm systems, reinforce doors and windows, and ensure adequate outdoor lighting. Keep your property well-maintained to give the appearance that it is occupied.
- Personal Safety Technology Suggestions: Consider installing security cameras and motion sensor lights. Use timer switches to turn lights on and off when you are not home to give the appearance that the house is occupied.
- Community Engagement Opportunities: Participate in neighbourhood watch programs and community meetings. Advocate for increased police patrols and improved lighting in areas perceived as less safe.
- Reporting Procedures and Important Contacts: Report any suspicious activity to the Toronto Police Service. In case of an emergency, call 911. For non-emergencies, contact the Toronto Police Service at (416) 808-2222.

Remember, your safety is paramount. Always be vigilant and aware of your surroundings, and do not hesitate to report any suspicious activity. By working together as a community, we can help to reduce crime and improve safety in the Bridle Path-Sunnybrook-York Mills neighbourhood.
