They may just drive it around to gain \u2018status\u2019 with their friends\n- To commit other crimes - Vehicles are stolen and used in other crimes such as robberies, break and enters, drug dealing or drive-by shootings\n- For vehicle cloning - Vehicles are stolen, given a fraudulent identification number and then sold to unsuspecting persons who are defrauded of their money.

        "### Comprehensive Safety Plan for North Riverdale, Toronto\n\n#### 1. NEIGHBOURHOOD-SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT:\n\n- **Current Safety Landscape:**\n  North Riverdale is generally considered a safe neighborhood, but like any urban area, it experiences certain crime patterns. While assaults are reported at a low level, break and enter incidents are at a medium risk level.\n\n- **Known Risk Factors and Patterns:**\n  Break-ins tend to occur more frequently in residential areas with less foot traffic. The risk is heightened during evening hours when homes are often unoccupied.\n\n- **Specific Areas or Times for Extra Caution:**\n  Evenings (around 7 PM) pose a slightly higher risk for break-ins as people are often commuting or not home. Be extra cautious in areas with less street lighting or isolated back lanes.\n\n#### 2. TARGETED SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n- **Break and Enter:**\n  - **Prevention Strategies:** \n    - Ensure all windows and doors are securely locked before leaving the house.\n    - Upgrade your basic alarm system to include window sensors and a security camera.\n    - Consider installing a security door brace and reinforcing door frames.\n  - **Warning Signs:**\n    - Unfamiliar individuals loitering in the area.\n    - Signs of tampering around doors and windows.\n  - **Immediate Actions:**\n    - If you suspect a break-in, do not enter the property. Call 9-1-1 immediately.\n    - Alert neighbors to increase vigilance.\n  - **Available Community Resources:**\n    - Neighborhood Watch Programs.\n    - Toronto Police Service's Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) consultations for personalized security assessments.\n\n#### 3. PERSONAL SAFETY PROTOCOL:\n\n- **Daily Safety Habits:**\n  - Always be aware of your surroundings, especially when traveling through less populated areas.\n  - Vary your routine slightly to prevent predictability.\n  - Keep a charged mobile phone with emergency contacts easily accessible.\n\n- **Essential Safety Tools:**\n  - Personal alarm or whistle for emergencies.\n  - Smartphone apps for personal safety that can alert contacts with your location.\n  \n- **Emergency Contact Information:**\n  - Emergency Services: 9-1-1\n  - Toronto Police Non-Emergency Line: 416-808-2222\n  - Crime Stoppers (anonymous reporting): 1-800-222-8477\n\n- **Community Support Services:**\n  - Local community centers offering safety workshops.\n  - Toronto Police Service community liaison officers for neighborhood safety concerns.\n\n#### 4. PREVENTIVE MEASURES:\n\n- **Home/Property Security Recommendations:**\n  - Keep shrubs and trees trimmed to eliminate hiding spots.\n  - Use timers for lights to give the appearance of occupancy.\n  - Engage with neighbors to keep an eye on each other\u2019s properties.\n\n- **Personal Safety Technology:**\n  - Smart home devices that allow remote monitoring.\n  - GPS tracking devices for personal use.\n\n- **Community Engagement Opportunities:**\n  - Attend local neighborhood association meetings.\n  - Participate in community clean-ups to improve neighborhood aesthetics and deter crime.\n\n- **Reporting Procedures and Important Contacts:**\n  - Report suspicious activities to Toronto Police Non-Emergency Line: 416-808-2222.\n  - For immediate threats, always call 9-1-1.\n  - Use Crime Stoppers for anonymous tips: 1-800-222-8477 or [www.222tips.com](http://222tips.com).\n\nThis plan aims to enhance your safety through practical steps and community engagement. While risks exist, being informed and prepared can significantly mitigate them. For specific concerns not addressed here, consider contacting the Toronto Police Service for further guidance.
