Properties become targets of crime for a variety of reasons.\n\nBy practicing the strategies outlined in this pamphlet you can reduce the risk of being victimized.\n\n### Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design Concepts\n\n**1\\. Natural Surveillance**\n\n* * *\n\nA design concept directed primarily at keeping intruders under observation. The primary goal of a surveillance strategy is to facilitate observation; it may also help to create an increased perception of risk to the offender.\n\n**Natural Surveillance Test**\n\nEvaluate your natural surveillance by answering these questions:\n\n- Does landscaping or fencing obscure the view to my property from neighbouring properties?",
        "### Risk Intervention (Downstream)\n\n- Risk intervention involves multiple sectors working together to address and/or interrupt escalating situations where there is an elevated risk of harm\n- What is learned by mobilizing risk intervention can inform how investments and strategies are deployed in the prevention and social development areas.\n\n### Incident Response\n\n- Immediate and reactionary responses that may involve a sense of urgency in response to crime or safety.\n- Initiatives in this area alone cannot be relied upon to increase community safety and well-being.\n\nPrioritized Challenges\n\n\nThe following areas have emerged from staff review of existing engagement and consultation data and reflect key principles in our approach to the SafeTO work \u2013 build on the existing community and institutional wisdom.

Consider using a buddy system or public transportation.\n  - Stay aware of your surroundings and avoid distractions like headphones or phone use in secluded areas.\n- **Warning Signs to Watch For:** \n  - Individuals following you or behaving erratically.\n  - Groups of people that seem aggressive or threatening.\n- **Immediate Actions:** \n  - If you feel threatened, move to a well-lit area or a public place, and call 911.\n- **Community Resources:** \n  - Contact local community centers for self-defense classes or personal safety workshops.\n\n#### 3. PERSONAL SAFETY PROTOCOL\n\n**Daily Safety Habits:**\n- Maintain awareness of your surroundings at all times.\n- Regularly change up your routine to avoid predictability.\n- Keep your phone charged and readily accessible.\n\n**Essential Safety Tools or Resources:**\n- Personal alarm or whistle.\n- Smartphone with emergency contacts set on speed dial.\n- Flashlight and basic first-aid kit.\n\n**Emergency Contact Information and Procedures:**\n- Emergency Services: Call 911 for immediate threats.\n- Toronto Police Non-Emergency: 416-808-2222 for non-urgent matters.\n- Report crimes anonymously via Crime Stoppers: 1-800-222-8477 or www.222tips.com.\n\n**Community Support Services Available:**\n- SafeTO Community Safety Programs for ongoing support and resources.\n- Local neighborhood watch groups.\n\n#### 4. PREVENTIVE MEASURES\n\n**Home/Property Security Recommendations:**\n- Reinforce entry points with high-quality locks and install security cameras if feasible.\n- Trim back hedges or trees that obstruct windows and doors to improve visibility.\n\n**Personal Safety Technology Suggestions:**\n- Use smart home devices for remote monitoring of your property.\n- Consider a personal safety app that shares your location with trusted contacts.\n\n**Community Engagement Opportunities:**\n- Participate in community meetings to stay informed about local safety issues.\n- Volunteer in neighborhood crime prevention initiatives.\n\n**Reporting Procedures and Important Contacts:**\n- Report any suspicious activity to Toronto Police Non-Emergency: 416-808-2222.\n- Utilize Crime Stoppers for anonymous tips when necessary.\n\nIn summary, while the Black Creek neighborhood presents certain safety challenges, staying informed and prepared can significantly enhance personal and community safety.

        "**Comprehensive Safety Plan for Oakridge (121), Toronto**\n\n---\n\n**1. NEIGHBOURHOOD-SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT:**\n\n- **Current Safety Landscape:** Oakridge is a residential area with a mix of single-family homes and apartment buildings. While generally considered safe during the day, there is an increased risk of break-ins and auto thefts during the evening and late-night hours.\n\n- **Known Risk Factors and Patterns:** The back alley behind homes and nearby parking lots have been identified as vulnerable areas, particularly in the evenings when visibility is lower, and there is less foot traffic.\n\n- **Specific Areas or Times for Caution:** Extra caution is advised during the evening and late-night hours, especially when parking in or walking through the back alley or parking lots.\n\n---\n\n**2. TARGETED SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n\nFor **Break and Enter:**\n\n- **Prevention Strategies:** Ensure all doors and windows are locked before evening. Consider installing motion-sensor outdoor lighting and security cameras to deter potential intruders and enhance surveillance around your home.\n\n- **Warning Signs:** Be alert for unfamiliar individuals loitering around your property, especially during the evening or night.\n\n- **Immediate Actions:** If you suspect a break-in, do not enter your home. Call 9-1-1 immediately and wait for the authorities.\n\n- **Community Resources:** Engage with local neighborhood watch programs and attend community meetings to stay informed about crime trends.\n\nFor **Auto Theft:**\n\n- **Prevention Strategies:** Use a steering wheel lock as an added layer of security. Park in well-lit areas, preferably under surveillance cameras, and consider installing a car alarm if not already equipped.\n\n- **Warning Signs:** Be wary of suspicious behavior around your vehicle, such as individuals trying to look inside or tamper with locks.\n\n- **Immediate Actions:** If you notice someone attempting to steal your vehicle, call 9-1-1 and provide a detailed description of the suspect and vehicle.\n\n- **Community Resources:** Report any suspicious activity in parking areas to the property management or local police using the non-emergency number 416-808-2222.\n\n---\n\n**3. PERSONAL SAFETY PROTOCOL:**\n\n- **Daily Safety Habits:** Develop a routine of checking locks and alarms each evening. Be observant of your surroundings when walking to and from your vehicle.\n\n- **Essential Safety Tools:** Keep a flashlight, personal alarm, and a fully charged mobile phone with you at all times.\n\n- **Emergency Contact Information:** Save emergency numbers in your phone, including 9-1-1 for emergencies, and 416-808-2222 for non-emergency police matters.\n\n- **Community Support Services:** Utilize the Community Paramedicine Program for safety advice and support services (https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/public-safety-alerts/community-safety-programs/community-paramedicine-program/).\n\n---\n\n**4. PREVENTIVE MEASURES:**\n\n- **Home/Property Security:** Reinforce doors with deadbolts and consider window security film. Keep hedges trimmed to improve natural surveillance.\n\n- **Personal Safety Technology:** Install a home security app linked to your phone for real-time monitoring of your premises.\n\n- **Community Engagement Opportunities:** Participate in local community events and safety workshops to foster a strong, vigilant community network.\n\n- **Reporting Procedures and Important Contacts:** Report crimes anonymously to Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477 or online at www.222tips.com.
