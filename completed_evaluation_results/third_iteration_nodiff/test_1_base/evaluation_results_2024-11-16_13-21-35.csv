            Neighbourhood: Black Creek (24)
            Primary Concerns: Break and Enter: high, Assault: medium

            1. NEIGHBOURHOOD-SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT:

The Black Creek (24) neighbourhood has been identified as having a high incidence of break and enters and a medium incidence of assaults.
