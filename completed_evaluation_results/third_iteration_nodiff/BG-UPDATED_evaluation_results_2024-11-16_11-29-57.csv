            1. NEIGHBOURHOOD-SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT:

Oakwood Village is a vibrant neighbourhood in Toronto. However, like any urban area, it has its share of safety concerns. The primary concerns in this area are robbery and auto theft, with break and enter being a lesser concern. It's important to be particularly cautious during the evenings, as this is when you spend a significant amount of time outside.

- Robbery: Be aware of your surroundings, especially during the evenings. Avoid deserted areas and always have your keys ready when walking to your vehicle. Keep your car doors locked and windows rolled up whenever possible.

3. PERSONAL SAFETY PROTOCOL:

Develop daily safety habits such as being aware of your surroundings, especially during the evenings. Keep emergency contact numbers handy. In case of an emergency, call 911. For non-emergencies, contact the Toronto Police Service at 416-808-2222. 

4. PREVENTIVE MEASURES:

Enhance your home security by keeping all doors and windows locked, especially when you're not at home. Consider upgrading your alarm system for added security. Engage with your community through neighbourhood watch programs. Report any suspicious activity to the police immediately.

            CITY OF TORONTO SERVICE SAFETY PLAN
            Neighbourhood: Taylor-Massey (61)
            Primary Concerns: Robbery: low, Auto Theft: medium, Break and Enter: high, Assault: medium

            **1. NEIGHBOURHOOD-SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT:**

Taylor-Massey is a neighbourhood where you have expressed concerns about auto theft, break and enter, and assault, particularly in the late evening and nighttime. You've also mentioned feeling less safe around the parking lots near the main shopping area. 

**2. TARGETED SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS:**

**Robbery**: Although your concern is low, it's important to stay vigilant. Avoid distractions like headphones or mobile devices when walking alone, especially at night. Stick to well-lit areas and be aware of your surroundings.

**Auto Theft**: Given your medium concern, always lock your car, even if you're leaving it for a short time. Keep valuables out of sight and never leave your vehicle running unattended. Pay extra attention in the parking lots near the main shopping area where you've expressed feeling less safe.

**Break and Enter**: Your concern is high due to a friend's experience. Improve home security by installing deadbolt locks, keeping windows locked, and maintaining good visibility by trimming bushes and trees near windows. Consider installing a security system or cameras. 

**Assault**: With a medium concern, remember to trust your instincts. If a situation feels wrong, leave if possible. If you're assaulted, attract attention by shouting or activating an alarm. Try to remember as many details about the assailant as possible for reporting to the police.

**3. PERSONAL SAFETY PROTOCOL:**

Develop daily safety habits such as checking your home's entry points before leaving and upon returning, and being aware of your surroundings, especially in areas where you feel less safe. Keep your mobile phone charged and accessible. 

In case of emergency, dial 9-1-1. For non-emergencies, contact the Toronto Police Service at 416-808-2222. You can also report crimes anonymously through Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477(TIPS) or online at www.222tips.com.

**4. PREVENTIVE MEASURES:**

Improve your home security with measures such as installing a peephole in your front door, using timers to turn lights on and off when you're not home, and marking your property with an engraver to deter thieves. 

Consider personal safety technology such as a personal alarm or a mobile safety app. Engage with your community through neighbourhood watch programs or community safety meetings. 

Always report suspicious activity to the police. Remember, your safety is paramount, and the Toronto Police Service is here to help.

            CITY OF TORONTO SERVICE SAFETY PLAN
            Neighbourhood: Oakridge (121)
            Primary Concerns: Robbery: medium

            1. NEIGHBOURHOOD-SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT:

The Oakridge neighbourhood has seen an increase in robbery incidents, which is the primary safety concern. The risk factors include walking alone at night and areas with poor lighting or low visibility. It is recommended to exercise extra caution during late hours, especially in areas that are not well-lit or heavily trafficked.

2. TARGETED SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS:

Robbery:
- Prevention Strategies: Advocate for the creation of well-lit community gathering areas and the installation of physical barriers in areas where robberies have been reported. Organize community activities in these areas to increase the perception of safety.
- Warning Signs: Be aware of your surroundings, especially if you notice individuals who seem out of place or exhibit suspicious behaviour.
- Immediate Actions: If you feel you are being targeted, move towards an area with more people and/or a nearby escape route. In the event of a robbery, do not resist, especially if the robber implies they have a weapon. Try to remember distinctive points of identification about the suspect.
- Community Resources: Report any crimes to the Toronto Police. You can also report a crime anonymously by calling Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477(TIPS) or online at www.222tips.com.

3. PERSONAL SAFETY PROTOCOL:

- Daily Safety Habits: Avoid walking alone after dark, stick to well-lit/high-traffic areas, and stay alert. Keep a record of valuables and identify property using a Trace Identified pen.
- Essential Safety Tools: Consider carrying a personal alarm or whistle. Keep your phone charged and accessible.
- Emergency Contact Information: In an emergency, call 9-1-1. To report a non-emergency crime, call 416-808-2222.
- Community Support Services: Engage with local community groups and neighbourhood watch programs.

4. PREVENTIVE MEASURES:

- Home/Property Security: Continue using security cameras at home. Report burnt out lights on the property to the building superintendent or management immediately.
- Personal Safety Technology: Consider using a personal safety app on your phone that can alert authorities or trusted contacts in case of an emergency.
- Community Engagement: Advocate for the implementation of Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) strategies in the neighbourhood. Participate in community activities to increase the perception of safety.
- Reporting Procedures: Report any suspicious activity to the police. Be a good neighbour by keeping an eye out for unusual activity and encouraging others to do the same.

Remember, your safety is a priority. By taking these steps, you can help to enhance your personal safety and contribute to the overall safety of the Oakridge community.
