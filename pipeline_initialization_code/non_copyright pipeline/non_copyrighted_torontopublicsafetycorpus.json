Think about where you are going and plan your route before you leave. Consider:\n\n\u2022\u00a0The time of day\n\n\u2022 When the next bus/streetcar/train is scheduled, is the route delayed or out of service?\n\n\u2022 How can you avoid walking through uninhabited or badly lit areas\n\n#### **Crime Prevention on Public Transit**\n\n**Safety Tips on the Street**\n\n* * *\n\n- Let others know where you\u2019re going and when you\u2019re expected to arrive/ return. Arrange to check in with them if possible\n\n- Know where you are going and walk with confidence\n\n- Avoid shortcuts (e.g. isolated areas/laneways/garages) and stick to well-lit/high-traffic areas to get to your destination.\n\n- Be aware of your surroundings (people, traffic and what\u2019s happening around you). If you feel uncomfortable or think that you are being targeted,\u00a0put your phone/device away and move towards an area with more people and/or a nearby escape route\n\n- STAY ALERT \u2013 LOOK UP \u2013 LOOK AROUND\n\n\n**Safety Tips While Waiting For Public Transit**\n\n* * *\n\n- Carry only what you need and have your fare ready \u2013 avoid rummaging through your purse/wallet while in public and don\u2019t keep your wallet in your back pocket\n\n- Know when the next transit vehicle is scheduled to arrive and time your arrival to minimize your wait time\n\n- Do not allow yourself to be targeted, when waiting in a transit shelter. Exit the shelter if you feel threatened or uncomfortable\n\n- Limit the use of electronic devices - this may target you\n\n\n**Safety Tips When Using Public Transit**\n\n* * *\n\n- Sit near the bus or streetcar driver, use the lead car or sit in a Designated Waiting Area (DWA) while using the subway\n\n- Be alert for people watching or following you\n\n- If someone is bothering you, change seats or alert the bus driver\n\n- Keep your personal belongings close to you (on your arm, between your feet, or on your lap). Avoid placing them under the seat where they can be easily stolen or forgotten\n\n- Remain vigilant. Thieves will often use distraction or trick you to take out your device. (For example, asking you to give them directions or the time)\n\n- Avoid using devices near the doors as it makes it easy for thieves to grab your property and run through the closing doors\n\n- At night, ask the driver to make a \u201cRequest Stop\u201d between regular bus stops\n\n\n**What You Should Know About Electronic Devices**\n\n* * *\n\n- Smartphone theft has overtaken purse theft\u00a0as a common crime type\n\n\n- Put a password lock on your device that doesn\u2019t contain any of your personal details and set the lock timer so your device locks a er a short period of inactivity\n\n- Keep a record of your device(s) unique IMEI number(s) \u2013 located on the original purchase box or you can dial **\\*#06#** on your cell to obtain\n\n- Check your IMEI number for free on [ProtectYourData.ca](http://ProtectYourData.ca) to ensure the device has not been reported lost or stolen in Canada.\n\n- Keep device software up-to-date to ensure that security features are working to their maximum capabilities\n\n- Consider installing an application that allows you to track your device (if one wasn\u2019t provided on your device)\n\n- Consider installing an application that will allow you to remove/erase data from your device remotely if lost or stolen\n\n- Watch out for \u201cshoulder surfers\u201d \u2013 people who stare over your shoulder. Treat your device as if you were entering a PIN number into a key pad when other people are around\n\n- Clear the device of all personal data when recycling/discarding your device [RecycleMyCell.ca](https://recyclemycell.ca/recycling-your-device/)\n\n\n**IF YOU ARE CONFRONTED:**\n\n* * *\n\n**DO WHATEVER YOU CAN TO PROTECT YOURSELF, BUT REMEMBER YOUR SAFETY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN PROPERTY**\n\n- Try to remember distinctive points of identification about the suspect and, if possible, write this down while it is still fresh in your memory\n\n- If someone demands your property and displays (or implies) that they have a weapon, DON\u2019T RESIST. You have a greater chance of getting hurt if you do\n\n- If someone tries to assault you, ATTRACT ATTENTION. Activate the Emergency Alarm - Yellow Stripe Alarm, scream, run - do whatever you can to get away - ONLY YOU can decide how to respond to an attack\n\n\nIf you see trouble, ask yourself what are my options - can you cross the street or go into a nearby store? If you are heading to an unfamiliar area, did you get directions prior to departing or do you have the capability to look this up while enroute?\n\n**OTHER HELPFUL TRANSIT SAFETY TIPS**\n\n* * *\n\n- Never step in front of or out from behind a transit vehicle\n\n- Do not walk across streetcar right-of-ways\n\n- Never purchase transit tickets, tokens or passes from any place other than an authorized TTC agent - they may be counterfeit\n\n- TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS - Trusting your own instincts that a situation seems \u201cwrong\u201d can be the best personal safety tool you have\n\n- Pay attention to it and don\u2019t be afraid to act on it.\u00a0A moment of embarrassment, if you are incorrect, is far less important than your overall safety\n\n\nFor further information about public transit safety, check out the [TTC website](http://ttc.ca)\n\nTo report a crime anonymously, call Crime Stoppers at: 1-800-222-8477(TIPS) or online at: [www.222tips.com](http://222tips.com)\n\nIn An Emergency: Call 9-1-1.\n\nTo report a crime to the Toronto Police that is not an emergency call\u00a0416-808-2222.\n\n## More Updates\n\n* * *\n\n[![](/media/filer_public_thumbnails/filer_public/f8/ce/f8ced020-9f7b-4059-8d7e-6220d7e9d97a/c248844b-cd1e-431c-8ff9-5bced8e3cb62.jpg__630x300_q85_crop_subsampling-2_upscale.jpg)](/crime-prevention/frauds-against-seniors/)\n\n### [Frauds Against Seniors](/crime-prevention/frauds-against-seniors/)\n\n\n\n\nScams targeting older people are now called \u201cthe crime of the 21st century\u201d, as they have become so widespread.\n\nSeniors are actively pursued by fraudsters for many reasons, including\n\n[![](/media/filer_public_thumbnails/filer_public/71/6d/716dee26-1e4b-4084-ac13-6eb78983e6f8/46c8debb-f6f6-4a4a-a985-263bb29e0726.jpg__630x300_q85_crop_subsampling-2_upscale.jpg)](/crime-prevention/identity-theft-1/)\n\n### [Identity Theft](/crime-prevention/identity-theft-1/)\n\n\n\n\nIdentity theft can happen to anyone.

The offenders look for exposed jewellery or may just assume their target is likely wearing it.\n\n### Distraction Theft\n\n**How Does The Offender Approach The Victim**\n\n* * *\n\nThe suspects generally travel as a group, in a vehicle or on foot, usually with a male, female and sometimes a toddler. This makes the suspects seem less suspicious. They may drive or walk around residential neighbourhoods, shopping malls, parks or approach you at bank machines where they will distract you by spraying you with ketchup or mustard.\n\nThey may even flatten your tire as a pretense to get you to stop your vehicle, where they will take advantage of this situation to offer \u201chelp\u201d as an excuse to get close to you and your jewellery.\n\nThe suspect then walks away leaving the victim confused, not realizing that their property has been taken.\n\n**Reduce The Risk Of Being A Victim**\n\n* * *\n\n- Avoid showy/flashy displays of jewelry\n\n- Take the safest route possible. Avoid shortcuts and deserted areas; try to keep to well lit and populated streets. Walk on the side of the street that gives you the best view\n\n- Walk with a purpose and be alert/aware of your surroundings\n\n- If you are suspicious of someone and they are not leaving you alone after you have asked them to, draw attention to yourself by yelling \u201cstop following me\u201d or \u201cleave me alone\u201d\n\n- DO NOT LET THEM TOUCH YOU\n\n- If you do not feel safe or are in need of assistance, flag down a passerby, car or taxi\n\n\n### The main property targeted by distraction theft offenders is expensive jewellery. However, wallets, cell phones and purse contents are also vulnerable to this type of theft.\n\n**If You Are A Victim Or Witness of Distraction Theft**\n\n* * *\n\nIf you realize that you have been a victim or witness of distraction theft and the suspect is still there or in sight, for your safety, DO NOT CHASE OR FOLLOW THE SUSPECT.\n\n- Call 9-1-1, the Police emergency number, immediately. The faster the Police are able to respond, the better the chances the suspect(s) will be arrested\n\n- Try to memorize suspect(s) information including physical and clothing descriptions, especially tattoos, scars and other prominent features, and any suspect vehicle information or description. This is very important information when the Police arrive and the suspects are no longer on scene\n\n- Keep records of your valuables and take photos. Note all serial numbers, the quality/value, engravings and distinguishing markings. Keep that information in a safe place at home. This information can help the Police identify and recover your property\n\n- If your valuables do not have serial numbers, consider \u2018marking\u2019 your property in a unique way with a Trace Identified pen\n\n\n**Crime Prevention Tips**\n\n* * *\n\n- If you are wearing expensive jewellery, ensure that it is properly affixed and not easily removed\n\n- If possible, conceal your jewellery under clothing\n\n- Be wary of strangers who do not respect your personal space or touch you in any way\n\n- If someone is close enough to put a necklace on you, THEY ARE TOO CLOSE!\n\n- Walk with a friend whenever possible\n\n- Be aware of who is around you and report any suspicious or criminal incident immediately to the Police or anonymously to Crime Stoppers\n\n\n**Suspect Description: (only record what you remember)**\n\n* * *\n\n- **M /\u00a0 F:**\n- **Ethnicity:**\n- **Age:**\n- **Height:**\n- **Build:**\n- **Weight:**\n- **Clothing Description: (ie: shoes, pants, shirt, jacket, hat)**\n- **Additional: (jewelery, tattoos, scars, complexion, deformalities)**\n- **Face: (ie: wrinkles, ear size, nose shape, eye size and colour, eyebrow shape)**\n- **Vehicle: (make, model, plate, colour, damage)**\n- **What was said?

This rapidly growing crime affects more people every day in Toronto and around the world.\n\nYet, surprisingly most people think it will not happen to them. Reasons for this increase include the proliferation of card-skimming devices and the hacking of computers.\n\n### **What Is Identity Theft?**\n\nSomeone takes possession of your credit card information, drivers licence, birth certificate, social insurance number, bank account or other personal information for the purpose of taking advantage of your credit rating. Once an identity has been stolen, the thieves begin to deplete your finances, leaving you to deal with the financial, legal and psychological costs.\n\n**How Do These Thieves Obtain Your Identity?**\n\n* * *\n\n- Shoulder surfing at automatic teller machines \u2013 thieves see Personal Identification Numbers (PIN), credit card numbers and/or passwords\n\n- Dumpster diving, recycling containers and see through garbage bags:\u00a0thieves rifle through trash looking for loan applications, credit card documents, financial documents and other personal information\n\n- Theft of personal property such as wallets, purses and private information contained in motor vehicles\n\n- Hacking of Computers: hackers gain access to computers targeting financial information or expose you to spyware\n\n- \"Phishing\"\u00a0occurs when a\u00a0fraudster sends you an email disguised as being sent from a bank, company or organization such as Revenue Canada for the purpose of enticing you to click on a link to update\u00a0your financial information\n\n- Buying Information from dishonest employees working for financial institutions or companies that process financial information. This includes workers at retail stores or medical offices. Stolen records are passed on or sold through chat rooms or instant-messaging sessions. Some companies have had their security breached compromising your personal information\n\n- Mail Boxes: removing your mail or having it redirected to another address or box. Thieves look for new credit cards, pre-approved credit offers, insurance statements, tax information, investment documents and benefit documents\n\n- Searching Public Sources such as newspapers (obituaries), phone books,online notices and records open to the public\n\n\n**Signs That Your Personal info Has Been Compromised!**\n\n* * *\n\n- A collection agency informs you they are collecting on an account in your name you never applied for in person\n\n- You no longer receive all your mail including credit card statements\n\n- You receive letters and/or telephone calls informing you that you\u2019ve been approved for credit products you never applied for in person\n\n\n**Guard Your Personal Information and Documents**\n\n* * *\n\nIf any key documents i.e. driver\u2019s licence, social insurance card, birth certificate, passport, bank or credit card are lost or stolen \u2013 notify the issuer IMMEDIATELY. Do not delay as the thief will attempt to use the information before it is reported stolen or lost.\n\n- Shred sensitive personal documents before disposing of them\n\n- Shield the entry of your PIN and never give it to anyone else. Choose a PIN that is not easy to figure out. Do not use your birthdate, phone number or a sequence of numbers and never write down your PINs and carry it in your wallet or in your cell phone. Store these\u00a0somewhere safe\n\n- Secure your mailbox, lock it if possible. Check your credit card statement when it arrives/investigate if it\u2019s late. Arrange to have a person you trust pick up your mail if you are travelling or go to the Post Office and ask for them to hold mail service\n\n- Carry only documents\u00a0you absolutely need. Only carry your birth certificate, passport and social insurance number card when needed\n\n- Photocopy your credit cards\u00a0back and front. This will help you if you need to alert the company should they be lost or stolen\n\n\n**Guard Your Personal Information On The Computer**\n\n* * *\n\n- Protect your computer with a start-up password only you know. Never use weak or obvious passwords such a 1-2-3-4-5-6, your birthdate or the word \u201cpassword.\u201d\u00a0Do not use automatic login features that save your username and password\n\n- Phishing \u2013 be on guard for phishing scams by means of phone or internet in which thieves falsely claim to be representatives of legitimate enterprises. This includes:\n  - thieves claiming to represent Microsoft or \u201cWindows\u201d and want your computer\u2019s password to fix an alleged problem, or\n\n  - emails that appear to be from a financial institution, Revenue Canada, eBay etc. notifying you of a security breach\n\n- NEVER click on links they provide to update your information\n\n- Pharmers \u2013 simply redirect as many internet users as possible from legitimate commercial websites and lead them to malicious sites that look legitimate. This is done by an embedded link,\u00a0which claims to bring you to a secure site. When users enter their login name and password,criminals can capture this information\n\n\n**Signs That Your Personal info Has Been Compromised!**\n\n* * *\n\n- A collection agency informs you they are collecting on an account in your name you never applied for in person\n\n- You no longer receive all your mail including credit card statements\n\n- You receive letters and/or telephone calls informing you that you\u2019ve been approved for credit products you never applied for in person\n\n\n**If You Think Your Identity Has Been Stolen**\n\n* * *\n\n- Start taking notes about what has occurred and steps you\u2019ve taken.\n\n- Contact the fraud/security department of your creditors for any accounts that have been opened or tampered with. This includes utility companies, credit card companies, banks and other lenders\n\n- Ensure a \u201cfraud alert\u201d be placed on all your files immediately\n\n- Contact the two main Canadian credit bureaus:\n  - Equifax: 1-866-828-5961\n\n  - Trans Union: 1-800-663-9980\n\n**Tips For Computer Use**\n\n* * *\n\n- Never use a public Wi-Fi network to conduct for financial transactions and always clear your browser history\n\n- Change your Wi-FI router password from the factory setting\n\n- Ensure that you use a robust firewall with the latest \u201cdefinitions\u201d for the anti-virus software and keep it updated\n\n- Never open emails from sources you don\u2019t know and appear suspicious. Delete them from your inbox\n\n- Look for secure websites that begin with **https://**\n\n- Look for an icon of a lock or an unbroken key\n\n\nTo report a crime anonymously, call Crime Stoppers at: 1-800-222-8477(TIPS) or online at: [www.222tips.com](http://222tips.com)\n\nIn An Emergency: Call 9-1-1.\n\nTo report a crime to the Toronto Police that is not an emergency call\u00a0416-808-2222.\n\n## More Updates\n\n* * *\n\n[![](/media/filer_public_thumbnails/filer_public/f8/ce/f8ced020-9f7b-4059-8d7e-6220d7e9d97a/c248844b-cd1e-431c-8ff9-5bced8e3cb62.jpg__630x300_q85_crop_subsampling-2_upscale.jpg)](/crime-prevention/frauds-against-seniors/)\n\n### [Frauds Against Seniors](/crime-prevention/frauds-against-seniors/)\n\n\n\n\nScams targeting older people are now called \u201cthe crime of the 21st century\u201d, as they have become so widespread.\n\nSeniors are actively pursued by fraudsters for many reasons, including\n\n[![](/media/filer_public_thumbnails/filer_public/ce/6d/ce6dd200-694d-4040-a674-2f7a8ee49d83/449d58f4-4168-478a-a8ab-50e01f7a4e98.jpg__630x300_q85_crop_subsampling-2_upscale.jpg)](/crime-prevention/are-you-in-an-abusive-relationship/)\n\n### [Are You in an Abusive Relationship?](/crime-prevention/are-you-in-an-abusive-relationship/)\n\n\n\n\nHealthy relationships are based on love, trust and respect for each other.

Approach the job with a mature and responsible attitude. Every babysitting assignment should be carefully planned to ensure the safety and well-being of both you and the children you are responsible for while babysitting.\n\n### Babysitting Safety Starts With You\n\n**Getting Started**\n\n* * *\n\n**1\\. Enroll and complete:**\n\n- a First Aid/CPR course\n- a babysitting course which is available to young people over 11 years of age\n\n**2\\. Do NOT:**\n\n- \u00a0advertise on bulletin boards as it may solicit unwelcome responses\n- accept a job if you don\u2019t know the person calling -\u00a0ask who recommended you and check back. If in doubt, refuse\n\n3\\. Be businesslike and clearly state the days you are available, hours you may work, experience you have had and pay you consider fair.\n\n4\\.

You can minimize your risk by practicing the personal safety and crime prevention strategies outlined below.\n\n### Always Let Them Know if Someone's Home\n\nSince most residential break and enters happen during the day time when the homeowner is not home, it is important to realize that there is little chance of you encountering a burglar provided you do not do anything to hide the fact that you are home if someone knocks on your door. It is therefore important that you respond to all door knocks by speaking through a locked door unless you recognize the person. This includes training your children to safely respond to the door knock by having them let you know that someone is there or speaking through a locked door advising the person that you are busy. In the event that someone acts suspiciously \u2013 this includes asking for someone who doesn\u2019t live there \u2013 call Police.\n\n## Home Safety Starts With You\n\n**Detection in Your Neighbourhood**\n\n* * *\n\n- Keep your ears and eyes open for suspicious vehicles and people around your home\n- Do not confront possible suspects\n- Record the license plate numbers and description of suspicious vehicles\n- Record detailed descriptions of occupants of suspicious vehicles\n- Report your concerns and observations immediately to the Police\n\n**Reducing Your Risk**\n\n* * *\n\n- \u00a0Mark your property with a Trace Identified pen (www.traceidentifiedcom) or a unique identifier. This may discourage theft of valuables and will provide an easy way to identify stolen property\n- Record the contents of your home or cottage (including serial number) on paper or make a video recording and download it to a safe and easily retrieved place that is unlikely to be lost or stolen\n- Consider installing a home security system\n- Do not announce your absence on an answering machine or through social media (e.g. Facebook).\n- Check identification of sales and service people. Use the phone number in the phone book or on the website, not a number the person at the door provides\n- Don\u2019t hide keys in secret places. Instead leave a duplicate with a friend or trusted neighbour\n\n**If a Crime Has Occurred**\n\n* * *\n\n- Emergency Services (9-1-1) should be called if there is a crime in progress or an immediate threat to the safety of persons or property.\n- If you arrive at your home and suspect there has been a break-in do NOT enter - the criminal may still be inside.\n- Go immediately to a neighbour and call the Police.\n- Do NOT touch anything or clean up until the Police have inspected for evidence. \u2022 Note the license number of any suspicious vehicle\n\n**Protecting Your Home**\n\n* * *\n\n- Make sure exterior doors are solid core wood or metal\n- Install a good quality deadbolt lock on the door and a minimum four-hole security strike plate on your door frame. Use screws that are a minimum two inches in length, and longer where possible, so that they penetrate the main (unseen) structure that supports the door frame\n- Secure sliding glass doors with commercially available bars or locks, or put a wooden dowel or broom handle in the door track. Burglars look for sliding glass doors because they are the easiest to open\n- Keep garage and tool shed locked. Don\u2019t give a burglar the resources to break into your home\n- Remove all obstructions in your yard that could conceal a burglar breaking into your house\n- Limit access to out of reach windows, lower roofs, second story windows and balconies. Lock up ladders and other objects that can be used as platforms whenever possible. Watch for large, overhanging tree limbs that may provide a means of access\n- Ask a trusted neighbour to use your driveway or parking space when leaving the house for extended periods\n- If you are away, make sure that your residence looks like it is occupied. Have the sidewalks shoveled, mail collected, grass cut etc. Set the lights to come on and off at different intervals\n- Make \u201cwould-be\u201d thieves visible, install motion lights or leave an exterior light on to illuminate entranceways and rear yards\n\n**Always Let Them Know If Someone\u2019s Home**\n\n* * *\n\nSince most residential break and enters happen during the day time when the homeowner is not home, it is important to realize that there is little chance of you encountering a burglar provided you do not do anything\n\nto hide the fact that you are home if someone knocks on your door.\n\nIt is therefore important that you respond to all door knocks by speaking through a locked door unless you recognize the person.

Social isolation is also a big risk factor\n\n### Fraud Prevention Starts With You\n\n**Types Of Frauds And Scams:**\n\n**Emergency or Grandparent Scam:**\n\n* * *\n\nTypically, the caller self identifies as the senior\u2019s grandchild and requests money for an unexpected financial problem such as needed car repairs from an accident, overdue rent, emergency medical expenses or to secure release from jail. The senior, in response, states the name of the grandchild, thus providing an identity for the fraudster to continue the scam. The caller stresses that their parent (your son or daughter) must not be contacted, as well as the need for absolute secrecy. They, or an accomplice posing as a lawyer or Police Officer, will complete the fraud by providing instructions as to how to transfer the money.\n\n**Romance Scam:**\n\n* * *\n\nAfter engaging in an ongoing, online conversation through a dating website, a new-found friend, who is often from another country, declares their love and wants to visit the senior. The fraudster asks for a large sum of money to cover travel costs as they state that they cannot otherwise afford the trip. A request for cash may also be made to cover medical bills for themselves or a family member or for other pressing financial needs. It is rare for the fraudster and victim to actually meet, unless this scam takes place at the local level. The fraudster continues the swindle by making repeated and pressured requests for additional monies without ever revealing their true identity or purpose.\n\n**Home Renovation Scam:**\n\n* * *\n\nAfter answering a knock at your door, a \u201cfriendly\u201d fraudster who appears knowledgeable about construction, advises that they just happen to be working in the area and is prepared to offer you a one-time special to fix your roof, driveway or chimney as they have extra materials on hand. The fraudster targets seniors whose homes may need work as they feel they can get away with charging exorbitant fees in the belief that most seniors are not aware of the true costs of repairs. The sole intention of the fraudster is to get a signature on a contract, do little, poor or no work and take as much money\n\n**Fraud Sweepstakes, Lottery or Contest Scam:**\n\n* * *\n\nSeniors are informed via text message, mail, internet or phone that they have won the lottery, sweepstakes or contest. Scammers will advise that a fee or payment is required in order for you to collect your winnings. There may also be attempts to obtain personal and/or banking information as a condition for you to receive your prize. Once this information is received, your bank account will be drained and you could also become a victim of identity theft.\n\nThe above are just a few examples of the types of scams that are out there. People are reminded to be diligent and cautious when engaging in financial transactions without personal contact.\n\n**Crime Prevention Tips**\n\n* * *\n\n- Never allow strangers to enter your home (via internet, phone or door) and take information about you and/or your assets\n\n- Do not be pressured into signing contracts\n\n- Read contracts carefully and never sign contracts with any blank lines, as someone may later add clauses that will harm you\n\n- Do not be afraid to ask for advice from a trusted person\n\n- Never give or send cash\n\n- Keep your credit card in sight when paying and confirm the card you get back is yours\n\n- Do not volunteer personal information - guard it carefully\n\n- Shred or tear up bank statements, financial records or receipts with credit card numbers on them\n\n- Protect your Personal Information Number (PIN) and Social Insurance Number (SIN) by leaving your SIN card in a safe and secure place\n\n- Carry only necessary credit and debit cards with you\n\n- Remember the age-old statements: \u201cbuyer beware\u201d, \u201cif it seems too good to be true, it probably is\u201d and \u201cyou don\u2019t get something for nothing\u201d\n\n- And remember, if in doubt, do not proceed and call the Police immediately about anything suspicious\n\n\nFrauds and scams have a major financial impact on Canadians and cause severe economic hardship. The proliferation of scams is a direct result of an increasingly larger older population, as well as the enhanced use of social media, such as social networking and dating sites which frequently attract fraudsters.\n\nTo report a crime anonymously, call Crime Stoppers at: 1-800-222-8477(TIPS) or online at: [www.222tips.com](http://222tips.com)\n\nIn An Emergency: Call 9-1-1.\n\nTo report a crime to the Toronto Police that is not an emergency call\u00a0416-808-2222.\n\n## More Updates\n\n* * *\n\n[![](/media/filer_public_thumbnails/filer_public/71/6d/716dee26-1e4b-4084-ac13-6eb78983e6f8/46c8debb-f6f6-4a4a-a985-263bb29e0726.jpg__630x300_q85_crop_subsampling-2_upscale.jpg)](/crime-prevention/identity-theft-1/)\n\n### [Identity Theft](/crime-prevention/identity-theft-1/)\n\n\n\n\nIdentity theft can happen to anyone.

Properties become targets of crime for a variety of reasons.\n\nBy practicing the strategies outlined in this pamphlet you can reduce the risk of being victimized.\n\n### Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design Concepts\n\n**1\\. Natural Surveillance**\n\n* * *\n\nA design concept directed primarily at keeping intruders under observation. The primary goal of a surveillance strategy is to facilitate observation; it may also help to create an increased perception of risk to the offender.\n\n**Natural Surveillance Test**\n\nEvaluate your natural surveillance by answering these questions:\n\n- Does landscaping or fencing obscure the view to my property from neighbouring properties?\n\n- Are there any areas around my doors or windows where a person could hide?\n\n- Are there areas of contrast or shadow around my property where intruders can loiter without being seen?\n\n\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions, your property\u2019s natural surveillance needs to be improved. To address these concerns, consider adding motion sensitive lights, reducing or pruning trees and shrubs, or altering fencing so intruders can be seen.\n\n**2\\. Natural Access Control**\n\n* * *\n\nA design concept directed primarily at decreasing crime opportunity. The primary goal of an access control strategy is to deny access to a crime target and to create a perception of risk to the offender.\n\n**Natural Access Control Test**\n\nEvaluate your natural access control by answering these questions:\n\n- Do people routinely trespass on my property and/or fence line?\n\n- Can people trespass on my property without being seen?\n\n- Do people access my property in ways other than I intended?\n\n- Do any existing access routes lack natural surveillance?\n\n\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions, your property\u2019s access control needs to be improved. To address these concerns, consider better control of undesired movements onto and within your property. Install landscaping, fencing or barriers to restrict the movement of people when entering or exiting your property.\n\nWhen selecting fencing or landscaping materials, consider the maintenance requirements and the impact that landscaping would have on your ability to see intruders trespassing on your property. Keep patio furniture and outdoor equipment away from inaccessible windows and doors.\n\n**3\\. Territorial Reinforcement**\n\n* * *\n\nA design strategy that encourages people to take ownership and/or responsibility for a space.\n\n**Territoriality Test**\n\nEvaluate your territoriality by answering the following questions:\n\n- Do strangers regularly trespass on my property?\n- Is my property being used as a shortcut?\n- Does my property have an unlived-in or unkempt appearance?\n- Are there seldom-used sections of my property where people loiter or hang out?\n\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions, your property\u2019s territoriality needs to be improved. To address these concerns, incorporate design elements that help distinguish public from private property. For businesses and residences, this can be done through well placed low fences, hedges, flower beds, signage, other markers, and regular maintenance.\n\nIt is also critically important to maintain an \u201cillusion of occupancy\u201d when you\u2019re not home. This is extremely important in deterring thieves. This can be accomplished by making sure your lawn is maintained, your driveway is shoveled and your newspapers and mail are picked up. Set your lights to go on and off when you\u2019re not at home and have someone check on your property.\n\n**Useful Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design Strategies**\n\n* * *\n\nThe following strategies can be used alone or in combination to manipulate your property for the purpose of influencing desired behaviour.\n\n- Provide clear border definition of controlled space.\n\n- Provide clearly marked transitional zones which indicate movement from public to semi-private to private space\n\n- Create gathering areas at locations with natural surveillance and access control\n\n- Re-designate the use of space to provide natural barriers to conflicting activities\n\n- Improve scheduling of space to allow for effective use(parking for night shift workers closest to the building)\n\n- Overcome distance and isolation through improved communications\n\n- Place safe activities in vulnerable areas, e.g. community garden in vacant land\n\n- Place vulnerable activities in a safe place, e.g. kindergarten play area in school courtyard\n\n- Increase the perception of natural surveillance, especially around access control points\n\n\nTo report a crime anonymously, call Crime Stoppers at: 1-800-222-8477(TIPS) or online at: [www.222tips.com](http://222tips.com)\n\nIn An Emergency: Call 9-1-1.\n\nTo report a crime to the Toronto Police that is not an emergency call\u00a0416-808-2222.\n\n## More Updates\n\n* * *\n\n[![](/media/filer_public_thumbnails/filer_public/f8/ce/f8ced020-9f7b-4059-8d7e-6220d7e9d97a/c248844b-cd1e-431c-8ff9-5bced8e3cb62.jpg__630x300_q85_crop_subsampling-2_upscale.jpg)](/crime-prevention/frauds-against-seniors/)\n\n### [Frauds Against Seniors](/crime-prevention/frauds-against-seniors/)\n\n\n\n\nScams targeting older people are now called \u201cthe crime of the 21st century\u201d, as they have become so widespread.\n\nSeniors are actively pursued by fraudsters for many reasons, including\n\n[![](/media/filer_public_thumbnails/filer_public/71/6d/716dee26-1e4b-4084-ac13-6eb78983e6f8/46c8debb-f6f6-4a4a-a985-263bb29e0726.jpg__630x300_q85_crop_subsampling-2_upscale.jpg)](/crime-prevention/identity-theft-1/)\n\n### [Identity Theft](/crime-prevention/identity-theft-1/)\n\n\n\n\nIdentity theft can happen to anyone.

The seat should be level front to back. The seat height should be adjusted to allow a slight bend at the knee when the leg is fully extended. The handlebar height should be at the same level with the seat\n- Wear brightly coloured neon/fluorescent clothing when riding during the day or night (note: wearing white has not been shown to make you more visible)\n- \u00a0Ensure you have a properly fitted helmet - as required by The Highway Traffic Act, 104 2.1, cyclists under the age of eighteen years MUST wear a helmet while riding or operating a bicycle, and the chinstrap of the helmet must be securely fastened under the chin\n- At night, wear something that reflects light, such as reflective tape or markings, or flashing lights. Remember, just because you can see a driver, it does not mean the driver can see you\n\n**Cycling Safety**\n\n* * *\n\n- Use bike lanes whenever possible. If no bike lanes are available, ride about 1 meter from the curb in a straight line; look well ahead to avoid hazards such as potholes, sewer grates, debris and people opening car doors\n- Use caution when turning a corner as most collisions happen at intersections\n- Perform a shoulder check and signal before turning or changing lanes and try to make eye contact with drivers\n\n**Theft Prevention**\n\n* * *\n\n- Register your bicycle on the internet at www.torontopolice.on.ca and retain the information found at the bottom of this form.\n- Always lock your bicycle when not in use by placing a chain or cable through both wheels and the frame attached to a stationary object. Use a proper bicycle rack whenever possible and keep your lock away from the ground.\n- For added security, take the seat with you if it is fitted with a quick release mechanism or use a second, good quality lock that is of a different design than the first one as it will generally discourage/slow down a thief.\n- Remove the bicycle rack from your vehicle when not in use. A bicycle rack on a vehicle can attract bike thieves to your home. The more expensive the bike rack, the more attractive to a thief.\n- Remove any item, such as a saddle bag that you don\u2019t want stolen when leaving the bike unattended.\n- Ensure that any quick release wheels are secured by a chain, cable or lock.\n- Keep your bike locked and out of sight when storing it at home.\n- If your bike is stolen, report it to Police immediately and include your serial number.\n\n**Additional Tips**\n\n* * *\n\n- Place your signature on a piece of paper and have it laminated -then roll it up and put it inside your handlebars or inside your seat post. This can help you identify or recover a lost/stolen bike\n- KEEP a copy of your sales receipt\n\n**Under The Law**\n\n* * *\n\n- Your bicycle must be \u201cfit for the road\u201d. Make sure your lights, horn or bell,reflective tape, brakes and other components are in good working order and comply with The Highway Traffic Act.\n- A cyclist must stop for a Police Officer and identify themselves if requested to do so according to Section 218(1) of The Highway Traffic Act. If the cyclist refuses to identify themselves, the Police Officer may arrest the cyclist until identification (name and address) is provided.\n\nTo report a crime anonymously, call Crime Stoppers at: 1-800-222-8477(TIPS) or online at: [www.222tips.com](http://222tips.com)\n\nIn An Emergency: Call 9-1-1.\n\nTo report a crime to the Toronto Police that is not an emergency call\u00a0416-808-2222.\n\n## More Updates\n\n* * *\n\n[![](/media/filer_public_thumbnails/filer_public/f8/ce/f8ced020-9f7b-4059-8d7e-6220d7e9d97a/c248844b-cd1e-431c-8ff9-5bced8e3cb62.jpg__630x300_q85_crop_subsampling-2_upscale.jpg)](/crime-prevention/frauds-against-seniors/)\n\n### [Frauds Against Seniors](/crime-prevention/frauds-against-seniors/)\n\n\n\n\nScams targeting older people are now called \u201cthe crime of the 21st century\u201d, as they have become so widespread.\n\nSeniors are actively pursued by fraudsters for many reasons, including\n\n[![](/media/filer_public_thumbnails/filer_public/71/6d/716dee26-1e4b-4084-ac13-6eb78983e6f8/46c8debb-f6f6-4a4a-a985-263bb29e0726.jpg__630x300_q85_crop_subsampling-2_upscale.jpg)](/crime-prevention/identity-theft-1/)\n\n### [Identity Theft](/crime-prevention/identity-theft-1/)\n\n\n\n\nIdentity theft can happen to anyone.

Abusive behaviour should NEVER be confused with passion or \u201clove,\u201d it is simply wrong.\n\n**Getting Out Of An Abusive Relationship**\n\n* * *\n\nIt is vital that you recognize the signs of an abusive relationship to minimize any future harm. Do NOT make excuses for the behaviour or think that you can change it-your partner needs professional help. Remove and/or end the relationship. Your well being depends on it.\n\n**What If I Am The Victim Of Intimate Partner Violence**\n\n* * *\n\nIf you are the victim of intimate partner violence, call 9-1-1. INTIMATE PARTNER\u00a0VIOLENCE IS A CRIME. It is against the law for a person to assault or threaten another person in an intimate relationship. Violence in relationships can lead to serious injury, suicide and homicide.\n\n**INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE** includes acts used to maintain power and control over a person by creating fear and isolation. Abuse can take many forms, including physical, sexual, emotional, psychological and financial.\n\n**VICTIMS ARE ABUSED** in all social, religious, racial, cultural, income and educational groups regardless of age, sex, sexual orientation, marital or relationship status.\n\nThe Toronto Police Service is committed to assisting with the prevention and reduction of intimate partner violence through intervention and education, and by holding offenders accountable for their actions. The police are required to lay charges when there are reasonable grounds to believe an offence has occurred.\n\n**Whether you\u2019re married, living together or just dating, it is important that you know and recognize the signs of an unhealthy relationship as this can lead to trouble.**\n\n* * *\n\n#### Useful Contact Numbers\n\n**SCARBOROUGH GRACE HOSPITAL**\n\n416-495-2555\n\n[www.sacc.to](http://www.sacc.to)\n\n**NEW WOMEN\u2019S COLLEGE HOSPITAL**\n\n416-323-6040\n\n[www.womenscollegehospital.ca](http://www.womenscollegehospital.ca)\n\n**BARBRA SCHLIFER CLINIC**\n\n416-323-9149\n\n[www.schliferclinic.com](http://www.schliferclinic.com)\n\n**ABRIGO CENTRE**\n\n416-534-3434 (Portuguese)\n\n[www.abrigo.ca](http://www.abrigo.ca)\n\n**ARAB COMMUNITY CENTRE**\n\n416-231-7746 (Arabic, Armenian, French, Kurdish, Somali, Urdu)\n\n[www.arabcommunitycentre.com](http://www.arabcommunitycentre.com)\n\n**CENTRE FOR SPANISH SPEAKING\u00a0PEOPLES**\n\n416-533-8545\n\n[www.cssp-cghh.org](http://www.cssp-cghh.org)\n\n**COSTI**\n\n416-244-7714 (Italian)\n\n[www.costi.org](http://www.costi.org)\n\n**FAMILY SERVICE TORONTO**\n\n416-595-9230\n\n[www.familyservicetoronto.org](http://www.familyservicetoronto.org)\n\n**JEWISH FAMILY & CHILD SERVICE**\n\n416-638-7800 (French, Hebrew, Russian, Yiddish)\n\n[www.jfandcs.com](http://www.jfandcs.com)\n\n**KOREAN CANADIAN WOMEN\u2019S ASSOCIATION**\n\n416-340-1234\n\n[www.kcwa.net](http://www.kcwa.net)\n\n**NATIVE CHILD & FAMILY SERVICES**\n\n416-969-8510 (Ojibway, other native interpretation)\n\n[www.nativechild.org](http://www.nativechild.org)\n\n**OASIS CENTRE DES FEMMES**\n\n416-591-6565 (French)\n\n[www.oasisfemmes.com](http://www.oasisfemmes.com)\n\n**POLYCULTURAL IMMIGRANT AND COMMUNITY SERVICES**\n\n416-533-9471 (Polish, Russian, Ukrainian)\n\n[www.polycultural.org](http://www.polycultural.org)\n\n**SOUTH ASIAN FAMILY SUPPORT**\n\n416-431-4847 (Bengali, Dari, Farsi, Gujarati, Hindi, Pashto, Punjabi, Tamil, Urdu.

Do not leave the responsibility for your safety and security solely in the hands of others. Reduce your risk by protecting the personal safety and crime prevention strategies outlined below.\n\n### Safety Starts With You\n\n**Helpful Safety Hints**\n\n* * *\n\n- Keep a record of your valuables, storing only what you need or regularly use in your residence\n- Identify your property by using a Trace Identified pen (www.traceidentified.com)\n- If you notice burnt out lights on the property, report them to the building superintendent or management immediately\n- Be a good neighbour - report suspicious activity to the police and advise the building Superintendent or Management. If you see a stranger carrying items out of a neighbour\u2019s unit Call\u00a09-1-1\n\n**If A Crime Has Occurred**\n\n* * *\n\n- Call 9-1-1\u00a0if there is a crime in progress or an immediate threat to the safety of people or property\n- Do NOT enter your unit if the door is opened - the criminal may still be inside. Use your cell or neighbour\u2019s phone to call the police\n- Do NOT touch anything or clean up until the police have inspected for evidence\n- Note the licence plate number of any suspicious vehicle\n- Note the description of any suspicious person(s)\n\n**Lobby Security**\n\n* * *\n\n- Watch for strangers hanging around entry vestibules\n- Do NOT buzz or let anyone you do not know follow you into the building\n- Refer them to security or the building superintendent\n- Ensure that the main outer doors remain locked at all times\n- Make sure that only your first initial and last name appear on the lobby\u00a0directory, doorbell, mailbox and phone directory.\n\n**Elevator Security**\n\n* * *\n\n- Look who is in the elevator before you enter. If someone on the elevator\u00a0makes you nervous \u2013 do NOT get on -- take the next one\n- Get\u00a0off\u00a0the elevator if someone makes you feel uncomfortable\n- Whenever possible, stand near the control panel with your back against the side wall. In the event that someone touches or bothers you, run your hand over the control panel for the purpose of depressing as many floors as possible. This will cause the elevator to stop and the doors open, which should interrupt any attack\n\n**Door Security**\n\n* * *\n\n- Always make sure that your unit or apartment lock has been re-keyed (if not a new one installed) before you move in\n- Make sure that a good quality one-inch deadbolt lock on the door and a security strike plate on the door frame has been installed, as locks with key cylinders in the doorknob can be easily forced open\n- Keep your door locked, even when taking out the garbage or doing laundry\n- NEVER ignore a door knock or open your door to strangers. Burglars will sometimes target units by knocking on doors first\n- When responding to the door knock, ask \u201cWho is it?\u201d and look through the peep hole with the door still locked. Only open the door if you know the person or are satisfied they are someone you were expecting. Otherwise say \u201cGo away! I\u2019m calling the Police\u201d\n- NEVER rely on chain locks -- they provide poor security.

Identification numbers may be altered or removed, ownership certificates forged, parts sold or the vehicle repainted\n- For transportation - Thieves will use your vehicle to get where they want to go and later abandon the vehicle. They may just drive it around to gain \u2018status\u2019 with their friends\n- To commit other crimes - Vehicles are stolen and used in other crimes such as robberies, break and enters, drug dealing or drive-by shootings\n- For vehicle cloning - Vehicles are stolen, given a fraudulent identification number and then sold to unsuspecting persons who are defrauded of their money. Fraudulent vehicles will be located and seized by the Police\n\n**How to Reduce the Risk of Vehicle Theft**\n\n* * *\n\n**When parking your vehicle:**\n\n- Never leave a vehicle parked and running when you run an errand-even for a minute\n- Always, remove the keys and take them with you\n- Park in a well-lit, attended area if possible\n- Completely close and lock doors and windows\n- Turn your wheels towards the curb to make it harder to tow\n\n**When at home:**\n\n- If you have a garage, use and lock it\n- Install a motion sensor light to light up your vehicles and garage\n- If you have a rear-wheel drive car, back into driveway\n- If you have a front-wheel drive car, park front end first\n- Always set the emergency brake\n- Don\u2019t leave the original ownership or insurance cards in the vehicle when unattended - make a photocopy of both sides of the documents to leave in your vehicle\n- Drop business cards or address labels inside doors to assist with vehicle identification\n\n**Other important tips:**\n\n- Never hide a spare key in the vehicle, thieves know where to look\n- Be aware of your surroundings and drive with your doors locked\n\n**Preventing Theft From Your Vehicle**\n\n* * *\n\n- Never leave ANYTHING on display when you leave your vehicle. This Includes purses left in the front seat when pumping gas and power chords to run and charge devices as these may attract thieves to your vehicle\n\n- Lock all parcels and shopping bags in the trunk of your vehicle\n\n- Consider an alarm \u2013 Consider installing an alarm if you regularly leave your vehicle in accessible unattended places such as parking garage or a commuter parking lot. Remember to always take anti-theft precautions, regardless of whether you have an alarm as an alarm can only be expected to improve your chances of not being a victim\n\n**Invest in Vehicle Protection if Possible**\n\n* * *\n\n- Have an Ignition Kill Switch installed \u2013 The ignition kill switch will prevent your vehicle from starting without it being turned on. As only you will know its hidden location, it is a good deterrent against thieves. In the event that you have this switch installed, contact your insurer and ask for a discount\n- Visible Steering Wheel Lock \u2013 a visual deterrent to a thief\n- Consider installing a Vehicle Tracking System\u00a0- A vehicle tracking system uses GPS technology to locate and track your vehicle\n\n**If Your Vehicle is Stolen:**\n\n* * *\n\n**Report the theft to the Police Immediately. You should be ready to report the following vehicle information:**\n\n- Year and make, model, colour(s)\n- Licence number\n- Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)\n- Serial numbers of all special equipment\n- Special markings - decals, after-market parts, dents, scratches, other damage, etc.\n\nIf your accessories are stolen, the Police will need specific information to identify these items.

C-47) (\u201c _Criminal Records Act_\u201d) and has statutory mandates and authorities to conduct Vulnerable Sector Checks (VSC or VSCs).\n\nAnd whereas you, (the \u201cAgency\u201d) is seeking the TPS\u2019s assistance for the purposes of conducting VSCs for individuals seeking employment, volunteering, application to, or continuance in an educational institution or program or any other purpose as set out by the _Police Record Checks Reform Act_ (PRCRA).\n\nAnd whereas the only VSC process used is a 3rd party verification process, which requires an Agency Code for an Applicant\u2019s application.\n\nThe Agency, for the purposes of obtaining an Agency Code and for the purposes of using the TPS\u2019s services, agrees to the following terms and conditions.\n\n1. **PURPOSE**\n\n\nThis Terms of Service (or \u201cagreement\u201d) sets out the terms and conditions between the Agency and the TPS as it relates to Applicants applying for a VSC. By agreeing to this Terms of Service, the Agency is granted the time limited and revocable right, to obtain an Agency Code and VSC application form allowing an Applicant to obtain a VSC for employment, volunteering, application to, or continuance in an educational institution or program or any other purpose as set out by the _PRCRA_.\n\nAny disclosure of information pursuant to this Terms of Service shall only be for the purpose of assisting the Agency to determine the suitability of potential candidates or existing employees for positions, paid or unpaid, having direct contact with Children or Vulnerable Persons.\n\n2. **DEFINITIONS**\n\n\nFor the purposes of this Terms of Service, the following definitions apply:\n\n\u201cAgency\u201d means your institution, business, group, or other organization, charitable, non-profit, for profit, or otherwise, which provides services to Children and/or Vulnerable Persons;\n\n\u201cAgency Code\u201d means a unique code provided by TPS and used by the Agency to apply for a VSC;\n\n\u201cApplicant\u201d means an individual applying for a VSC for a position, paid or unpaid;\n\n\u201cAuthorized Representative\u201d means a person with legally binding signing authority for the Agency and who is 18 years of age or older;\n\n\u201cChildren\u201d means persons who are less than 18 years of age;\n\n\u201cRecord Suspension\u201d has the same meaning as defined and used under the Criminal Records Act;\n\n\u201cToronto Police Service\u201d or the \u201cTPS\u201d means the law enforcement agency that delivers police services to the City of Toronto in accordance with the _Police Services Act_, R.S.O. 1990 Chap. P-15 or any successor legislation;\n\n\u201cVolunteer\u201d means a person whom performs a service but who receives no compensation for doing so other than an allowance for expenses or an honorarium, and excludes a person receiving some other form of credit such as academic credit or fulfilling a sentence requirement;\n\n\u201cVulnerable Persons\u201d means a person who, because of his or her age, a disability or other circumstances, whether temporary or permanent,\n\n1. is in a position of dependency on others; or\n\n2. is otherwise at a greater risk than the general population of being harmed by a person in a position of trust or authority towards them.;\n\n\n\u201cVulnerable Sector Check\u201d or \u201cVSC\u201d has the same meaning as a vulnerable sector check as defined and used under the Police Record Checks Reform Act, 2015, S.O. 2015, c. 30.\n\n3. **DISCLOSURE OF VULNERABLE SECTOR CHECK INFORMATION**\n\n\nWhere the Agency requires a VSC from an Applicant, the TPS will only conduct the VSC if the Agency has agreed to this Terms of Service and the agreement has not expired, been revoked, or otherwise terminated.\n\nThe TPS will only disclose information obtained through a VSC to Applicants who duly execute a \u201cConsent to Disclosure of Personal Information Form\u201d (Application Form) requesting and authorising disclosure of information to themselves.\n\nThe TPS will not communicate the results of a VSC to the Agency.\n\n4. **LIMITS TO DISCLOSURE**\n\n\n**The Agency acknowledges and agrees that the determination of whether an Applicant is suitable as an employee, Volunteer, or candidate rests entirely with the Agency.** The Agency remains responsible for this determination of suitability irrespective of the existence or non-existence of any information derived from the police VSC. The TPS does not recommend, provide commentary, endorse, qualify, or disqualify any Applicant as to their suitability as an employee, Volunteer, or candidate with the Agency.\n\nThe Agency further acknowledges that the search and disclosure of information is based on the identifying information and personal descriptors provided by the Applicant and that the TPS does not warrant, nor guarantee, the VSC process will identify all existing information.\u00a0 The results of the VSC process will contain information up to the date of search and nothing in this Terms of Service shall be construed to be a continued obligation on the TPS to provide updated information to an Agency beyond the date(s) of a search. \u00a0\u00a0Nothing in this Terms of Service shall be construed to require the TPS to conduct periodic searches or searches in perpetuity for an applicant or Agency\n\nThe search and disclosure of information will be in accordance with applicable law. Where existing information may be known to an Agency or Applicant but is not otherwise revealed or disclosed as part of a VSC, this may be due to the requirements of applicable law, including, but not limited to following:\n\n1. _Police Record Checks Reform Act, 2015, S.O. 2015, c. 30_\n\n2. _Criminal Records Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.

M56_\n\n7. _RCMP Dissemination of Criminal Record Information Policy_\n\n\nThe Agency understands that information relating to an offence for which a Record Suspension (formerly a Pardon) has been granted may be available to persons or agencies responsible for the well-being of Children or Vulnerable Persons, and where an Applicant consents to release and under the following conditions:\n\n1.

Any dissemination or disclosure of information shall only be for the purposes outlined in Section 1 of this Terms of Service;\n\n2. The information obtained by the Agency will not be altered in any manner;\n\n3. The information shall be destroyed (shredded/mulched/permanently deleted) after use or maintained in such a manner to prevent unauthorized access or unauthorized use; and\n\n4. The information shall be retained, used, disclosed, or destroyed in accordance with all laws applicable to the Agency.\n\n\n6. **ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES**\n\n\nYou, the Agency, agree to the terms and conditions of this entire agreement.\u00a0 Obligations specific to the Agency include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n1.

The Agency will communicate directly with the Applicant to obtain disclosure of the results of any police VSC provided to the Applicant;\n\n6. The Agency agrees to keep their contact information up to date and shall notify the TPS forthwith in writing of any change of contact information.\u00a0 Notifications shall be sent to PRCPRegistration@torontopolice.on.ca.;\n\n7.

If the nature of the breach is such that it requires a longer period of time for it to be corrected, and if the Agency has promptly initiated efforts to correct the breach and is continuing the actions necessary to correct the breach, an extension shall be provided. If the Agency has not corrected the breach within the 14-day period, or has not initiated and continued its efforts to correct the breach within such period when the nature of the breach requires a longer time to be corrected, the TPS shall have the right to terminate this Terms of Service.\n\n10. **AMENDMENTS TO TERMS OF SERVICE**\n\n\nThis Terms of Service may be amended from time to time, and at any time, at the sole and unfettered discretion of the TPS.\n\nNotification of amendments will be provided by the TPS to the Agency via email.\u00a0 The Agency is responsible for keeping their contact information up to date in order to effect such notification and/or other communications, generally.\n\nThe Agency will be required to review and agree to amendments of the Terms of Service and/or a new Terms of Service prior to receiving a new Agency Code for use. Old Agency Codes will be void, at a minimum, with each amendment or new Terms of Service coming into effect.\n\nThe Agency is encouraged to check TPS\u2019 \u201cNotice of Amendments to Terms of Service\u201d ( [Click here to check for amendments](https://www.tps.ca/services/police-record-checks-terms-service/notice-amendments-police-record-checks-terms-service/?edit&language=en))\u00a0from time to time for the latest updates on the VSC process.\n\n11. **WAIVER**\n\n\nNo action, omission, or failure to act by the TPS shall constitute a waiver of any rights afforded to the TPS under this Terms of Service nor shall any action, omission, or failure to act constitute an approval of, or acquiescence in, any breach thereunder by the Agency or any person, except as may be specifically agreed to in writing.\n\n12. **INDEMNITY**\n\n\nThe Agency shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the TPS, the Chief of Police, the Toronto Police Services Board, and all of their respective employees, agents, officials, successors, and assigns from all claims, loss, damages, demands, and expenses arising directly or indirectly out of the provision or use of the services or information provided by the TPS pursuant to this Terms of Service, provided the claim, loss, damage, demand, or expense was not the result of negligence on the part of the TPS.\n\n13. **GOVERNING LAW**\n\n\nThis Terms of Service and the rights, obligations of the Agency and the TPS shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein.

Year after year, the majority of alarm activations reported to the TPS have been identified as false (97%). This means, police officers are responding to calls for service where there is no requirement for a police response. The TPS is striving to provide the best possible service to all members of the community. Other agencies that have implemented verified response have seen a reduction in the number of calls for service related to alarm events. By reducing response to false alarm events, the call takers, dispatchers and police officers will be more available to provide response to other calls for service and core police duties and responsibilities.\n\n- What is verified response?\n\n\nA verified response means there is some form of verification that an unwanted intrusion has occurred. The TPS has defined verified response as: The requirement of validation that criminal activity is occurring/has taken place OR there is imminent threat to personal safety PRIOR to requesting a police response.\u00a0 The verification requirement will apply to burglar alarm activations. It will NOT apply to panic alarm activations.\n\n- Has verified response been implemented in other jurisdictions?\n\n\nMany North American law enforcement agencies have successfully implemented a verified response protocol and have experienced a reduction in the number of false alarm events responded to.\n\n- When will the requirement for verified response be implemented?\n\n\nVerified response was implemented on September 10, 2018. Confirmation was communicated to all registered monitoring stations and posted on our website.\n\n- Will the TPS continue to respond to alarm activations?\n\n\nYes, the TPS will provide a response to alarm activations; however, a burglar alarm must be verified to confirm an unwanted intrusion prior to requesting a police response. Once the burglar alarm activation has been verified, the TPS will provide a response. The TPS will provide a response to panic alarm activations and a verification process will not be required.\n\n- How is a burglar alarm activation to be verified?\n\n\nA burglar alarm may be verified using one or more of the following methods: \u2022 Audio device; \u2022 Video device; \u2022 Multiple zone activations; or \u2022 An eye witness (i.e. private security or person at scene).\n\n- What is considered to be a burglar alarm?\n\n\nA burglar alarm activation includes, but is not limited to, alarm distinctions described as burglar, motion, door, window, glass break, etcetera.\n\n- What is considered to be a panic alarm?\n\n\nA panic alarm activation includes, but is not limited to; alarm distinctions described as panic, hold-up, duress, emergency button, etcetera.\n\n- Why doesn\u2019t the TPS increase the false alarm fee?\n\n\nAn increase in the false alarm fee has not seen a significant reduction in the number of alarms reported and identified to be false. In 2010, the false alarm fee was increased to $130 from $83.50. The number of alarm events reported to the TPS have remained over 23,000 and 97% have been identified as false.\n\n- As an alarm client, what should I do?\n\n\nOwning and operating an alarm system involves a private contract with a private and for-profit business that is providing a private service. The TPS recommends that alarm clients contact the alarm dealer and/or monitoring station to discuss current alarm system set-up, alarm settings and response options.\n\n### Share\n\nShare\n(opens in new window) Tweet\n(opens in new window) Email\n(opens in new window)\n\nLinkedIn\n(opens in new window) Reddit\n(opens in new window) Copy URL",

The information in the database includes details such as specific behaviours officers might encounter, recommended de-escalation strategies and contact information for family members or other individuals who can provide support.\n\nDispatchers, police officers and other support personnel will then be able to access this information when they are interacting with the person. This leads to a better understanding of the causes for behaviours and provides officers with information about how to best assist the person.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\nExpand All\n\n- Who can provide information for the Vulnerable Persons Registry?\n\n\nThe information will only be accepted if it is entered by the vulnerable person named in the record, their parent or guardian or a person with power of attorney or similar authority over the individual. A verification process will follow the data entry to ensure that the person entering the data had the authority to do so.\n\n- What are the advantages of entering this information in the Vulnerable Persons Registry?\n\n\nThe information entered into this system becomes available to frontline police officers as soon as it has been verified. This provides frontline officers with important context about any behaviours they may observe when they are assisting a vulnerable person.\n\n- What kind of information will be recorded in the Vulnerable Persons Registry?\n\n\nThe information can include the following but many fields are not mandatory:\n\n- The name, date of birth, address and description of the person\n\n- The name, address, contact information of the individual entering the data and any other support person who might be able to assist the person being registered\n\n- Behaviours that may be exhibited by the person\n\n- Locations where the person might be located if reported missing\n\n- Triggers or subjects to avoid discussing\n\n- It is not mandatory, but if the person entering the information wishes to do so they can also provide a photograph, information about the person\u2019s physician and medical conditions.\n\n- How does this differ from the Medic Alert Connect Protect program?\n\n\nWhile the Toronto Police Service Vulnerable Persons Registry captures much of the same information as the\u00a0**Connect Protect**\u00a0program the information is used in different ways.\u00a0**Vulnerable Persons Registry**\u00a0information is available to officers before they arrive at a radio call while\u00a0**Connect Protect**\u00a0information is generally accessed after officers have identified that an individual is wearing a Medic Alert bracelet and requires assistance.\n\nAs a result, the Toronto Police Service strongly recommends registering in both initiatives. This ensures that vulnerable members of the community will receive the appropriate care and assistance that they might need. Please visit the\u00a0[Medic Alert Connect Protect sign-up page](https://www.medicalert.ca/Programs/MedicAlert-Connect-Protect)\u00a0to register for that progam.\n\n- How will this information be used by police?\n\n\nThis information will only be used by officers to obtain background information about people they are dealing with unless the person is reported missing. In those cases the missing person\u2019s photograph (if provided), name and description may be shared with the media, TTC, Toronto Community Housing or Hospitals.\n\n- Will this information be used in police background screenings?\n\n\nNo. The information provided in the Vulnerable Persons Registry will not be provided to potential employers or other civilian organizations.\n\n- How long will the Toronto Police Service retain this information?\n\n\nThe registered person's information will remain in the database for two years. This time frame can be extended by the person who entered the data by adding a\u00a0[supplemental report to the original report](https://core.tps.ca/dors/startreport/100001500/101865500).\n\n- How do I remove a vulnerable person\u2019s information from the database?\n\n\nThe person who submitted the information can request that it be removed from the registry at any time by sending a\u00a0[supplementary attachment to the original report](https://core.tps.ca/dors/startreport/100001500/101865500).\n\n### Terms and Conditions\n\nWhen submitting information to the Vulnerable Persons Registry you areagreeing that the information you are providing is correct to the best of your knowledge.\n\n**Providing false information in this report is a criminal offence.**\n\n# **Submit to\u00a0Registry**\n\nPrefiling Question Verification - OnTorontoPs\n\n![Citizen\\'s Online Reporting System](https://core.tps.ca/dors/assets/ctx/a8ccbe75/images/agency/OnTorontoPs/header.jpg)\n\nVulnerable Person RegistryDefinitionThis form allows citizens to register vital information pertaining to themselves, vulnerable family members or other persons in their care.

Watch for Signs and Pavement Markings\n\nAs the pressure for on-street parking continues to build, more areas of Toronto have posted parking restrictions. New residential permit parking zones are added each year, time limit areas expand and rush hour signs multiply. Signs without specific times listed are in effect 24 hours a day. Tow away signs are posted in some areas as an extra reminder, but are not required for vehicles to be towed.\u00a0 Many bike lanes have been added to city streets.\n\n#### 2\\. Read the Pay and Display Machines/Parking Meters\n\nHurried motorists often forget to check the information on the parking machine before making payment. Always make sure you check the days and hours the machine is in effect or whether there are rush hour restrictions which require the vehicle to be moved.\n\n#### 3\\. Be Courteous - Do not Park in Reserved Parking Spaces\n\nShow consideration for the parking spaces reserved exclusively for vehicles displaying valid Accessible Parking Permits both on-street and on private property. When non-permit holders park in these spaces, those with disabilities are often left with no other parking alternative.\n\n#### 4\\. Stay Away from Corners\n\nThe space at the end of the block is an inviting temptation to the frustrated driver looking for a parking space. Beware! The City of Toronto requires vehicles park at least 9 metres from the curb line of the intersecting street. The corner clearance is intended to provide pedestrians, cyclists and motorists with a clear field of vision and plenty of space when approaching intersections.\n\n#### 5\\. Leave Bus Stops for Buses\n\nMotorists often pull into bus stops to wait for a friend, buy a cup of coffee or use a bank machine. Even a quick stop blocks the zone, forcing transit drivers to unload or load passengers on the street. This is a potential hazard for elderly and disabled passengers and an inconvenience for other motorists when the bus is unable to pull into the zone.\n\n#### 6\\. Use off-street Parking\n\nDo your meetings run late? Does the doctor keep you waiting? Utilizing off-street parking options will avoid the hassle of worrying about an expired parking machine, moving your vehicle out of a time limit area, or your vehicle being subject to rush hour route provisions. The purpose of timed parking areas is to encourage the turnover of vehicles in places where there is a high demand for on-street parking.\u00a0 If your appointment requires longer-term parking, save the cost of a ticket and use the parking lot.\n\n#### 7\\. Park Safely at Schools\n\nIt's 3:00 p.m. on a weekday\u00a0afternoon, hundreds of elementary school children are heading home. Parents are waiting to pick them up. Where can these vehicles park safely? Most schools have signed areas that are designed to accommodate motorists dropping off or picking up children. Drivers should not use the no stopping or no parking zones in the vicinity of schools. These areas are usually located on either side of the street near schools and must be kept clear to provide clear visibility for motorists and students. Drivers should never double park to load or drop off children from their vehicles. This places children in a dangerous position of crossing a lane of traffic without seeing or being seen by other motorists.\n\n#### 8\\. Know the Difference Between No Parking, No Stopping and No Standing\n\nThe No Stopping Anytime and No Standing Anytime symbols are the most restrictive parking regulations in Toronto. Once a vehicle has ceased moving, even if occupied, it is deemed stopped or standing. If a driver chooses to stop or stand in any of these zones, they can be ticketed and towed. The No Parking Anytime symbol is less restrictive. Drivers are allowed to use these zones while actually engaged in loading or unloading goods or to pick up or discharge passengers. Remember, the key is \u201cwhile actually engaged.\u201d\u00a0 Do not leave your vehicle unattended in these areas.\n\n#### 9\\. Respect Residential Parking Restrictions\n\nIn responding to neighbourhood concerns about parking pressures, the City of Toronto has established many residential permit parking zones. These areas are clearly posted and for the exclusive use of area residents during posted times. Other parking alternatives are available for visitors and service people.\n\n#### 10\\. Err on the Side of Caution\n\nHave I parked too close to the corner? What do those signs mean? Am I blocking another vehicle? If you're not sure, find another spot. Parking Enforcement receives thousands of complaints each year from people inconvenienced by a poor parking decision.\n\n### Share\n\nShare\n(opens in new window) Tweet\n(opens in new window) Email\n(opens in new window)\n\nLinkedIn\n(opens in new window) Reddit\n(opens in new window) Copy URL",

The Canadian Criminal Real Time Identification Service destroys fingerprint submissions when the search is completed and verification is made. The results of your verification are never retained.\n\nFurther information on the RCMP policy is\u00a0[available on their website here](https://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/en/types-criminal-background-checks)\u00a0(opens in same window).\n\nIf there is a match of your gender and date of birth to one or more individuals on the RCMP\u2019s pardoned sex offender database, the Toronto Police Service will send you correspondence with the following two options:\n\n**Option 1**\n\nYou may attend Toronto Police Headquarters at 40 College Street to have your fingerprints taken.

Under the Act, individuals may request access to general records or records containing their own personal information.\n\n#### Municipal Freedom of Information & Protection of Privacy Act (M.F.I.P.P.A.)\n\nThe Toronto Police Service processes requests under the [Municipal Freedom of Information & Protection of Privacy Act](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90m56) which gives individuals a right of access to information, however, some disclosure exemptions may apply. Under the Act, individuals may request access to general records as well as records containing their own personal information.

The need for this service arises from police contact with vehicles such as those recovered after being stolen, impounded for by-law infractions, or those impounded following the arrest of a driver. Over the years, the TPS has developed a standard to ensure that contracted towing and pound service providers deliver acceptable levels of service to both the community and the Service.\n\n#### Toronto Police Service Contract Towing & Storage Fees\n\nStandard tow fees apply to all police authorized impounds of vehicles with a gross vehicle weight of less than 7004\u00a0lbs. (3177 kgs), and medium tow fees apply to all vehicles with a gross vehicle weight of 7004 lbs (3177 kgs) to 13,227\u00a0lbs (6000 kgs), located within the road allowance or where the tow truck can be driven to the vehicle to be towed. The use of dollies is included in the standard & medium tow rates. Winching and off-road recovery costs are permitted to be charged in addition to the flat rate when applicable.\n\nThe storage day is 24 hours from the time the vehicle arrives at the pound. Twenty-five per cent of the 24 hour storage fee is chargeable for each hour of the first 4 hours, which shall include any part of an hour. One hour is payable as soon as the vehicle arrives at the pound. (The hourly rate and minimum rate will reapply at the conclusion of each 24 hour period.)\n\n#### Comments, Questions and Complaints\n\nAny concerns can be forwarded directly to the towing contractor, their contact information is listed above.

In the event the cyclist or pedestrian do not remain at the scene of the collision, it can subsequently be reported at a Collision Reporting Centre (CRC).\n- Collisions that occur between 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., where any vehicle is not drivable\n\nIf the collision you are involved in in does not meet the above criteria, but does meet the minimum requirements as set out by the Ontario Highway Traffic Act to report the collision to police, you **MUST** report your collision to a CRC. Read the steps below.\n\n#### What to Do If You're In a Collision\n\n1. **Establish if anyone is hurt?** If anyone has suffered an injury resulting in the person being transported to a hospital or there is any evidence of criminality, **Call 9-1-1 right away**.\n2. **Take a Breath.** Keep in mind that this is a stressful situation for everyone involved and to remain calm.\n3. **Clear the road**. If it is safe to do so and the vehicles can be moved, move all involved vehicles to an area of safety, clearing the road for other drivers.\n4. **Assess damage**. If the involved vehicles have over $2,000 combined damage you must report the collision to police immediately to a Collision Reporting Centre (locations below). If damage is very minor, please contact your insurance company to talk about your options.\n5. **Exchange information**.

Taking a picture of each other\u2019s information on your cell phone is a quick and accurate\u00a0way to exchange information in what is a stressful situation. Take photos of the collision scene and damage to your vehicle too.\n7. **Talk to witnesses**.\u00a0Exchange information with any witnesses so police can contact them if necessary.\n8. **Report the Collision**. As soon as possible, bring your vehicle to\u00a0the Collision Reporting Centre most convenient to you along with your driver\u2019s licence, vehicle ownership and insurance information.\n\n#### What is a Collision Reporting Centre?\n\nThe Collision Reporting Centres in Toronto are partnerships between the Toronto Police Service and [Accident Support Services International](https://accsupport.com/) that assists motorists, cyclists and pedestrians in reporting motor vehicle collisions that\u00a0they have been involved in.

If you are seriously hurt, call 9-1-1.\n\nCyclists/Pedestrians can also report at a **new collision reporting centre at\u00a014 Division**\u00a0at [350 Dovercourt Rd](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/350+Dovercourt+Rd,+Toronto,+ON+M6J+3E5/@43.6510489,-79.4284751,17z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x882b3457d10c76b7:0x8bff27d75d5a78ec!8m2!3d43.651045!4d-79.4259002!16s%2Fg%2F11csdnlwjt?entry=ttu). It is also operated by Accident Support Services International and available from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday to Friday (excluding holidays). Please see the brochure below for more details:\n\n### Pedestrian and Cyclist CRC Kiosk Brochure\n\n[Download File](/files/download/1716811263/44637/)\n\nPlease note that some documents might not render correctly in your browser.\nFor best experience, download/save the document to your desktop first.\n\n\nCyclists/Pedestrians will be able to begin reports online at\u00a0[accsupport/PedCylistApp/home](https://pedcyclist.accsupport.com/home).\n\nAll reports started online must be finalized at any of the Collision Reporting Centres during hours of operation.\u00a0\u00a0The report is not considered complete until the reportee has presented valid ID to the customer service representative.\n\n#### When You Get Towed\n\n**ALL** vehicles being towed from the collision scene **MUST** go directly to a CRC location.\n\nA flat fee of $310.44\u00a0plus tax will be charged by the towing company from any street or highway after a collision. This rate is established by Toronto Municipal Code Chapter 545 and applies for towing directly to the Collision Reporting Centre. \u00a0This does not cover any subsequent tow that is needed. \u00a0This initial fee is paid directly by the Collision Reporting Centre and there is no need to pay the driver.\n\nToronto Municipal Code Chapter 545 forbids tow truck operators from recommending a body shop or other repair facility to you. Under Chapter 545, if requested, tow truck operators are required to show you a copy of the rate schedule they have filed with the City of Toronto.\n\n##### Choosing a Towing Service\n\n- You have the option to use the tow truck at the scene OR choose another tow truck of your choice\n- Ask to see the tow truck schedule of rates before you enter into any agreement to tow your vehicle\n- You can choose the body shop of your choice to repair your vehicle. **If in doubt, contact your insurance company for further instructions**.\n\n#### Read more about Towing Practices & Contracts\n\n[View](/services/towing/)\n\n### Share\n\nShare\n(opens in new window) Tweet\n(opens in new window) Email\n(opens in new window)\n\nLinkedIn\n(opens in new window) Reddit\n(opens in new window) Copy URL",

It is a Toronto Police Service-led program that provides training to Canadian law enforcement members so they can safely assist military veterans who officers encounter on their daily duties and provide them with the appropriate referral services.\n\n#### Overview\n\nThe Toronto Police Service Military Veterans Wellness Program began development in 2019 by veterans for veterans.\u00a0 The program aims to achieve prosperity for all of our Canadian Armed Forces veterans and increased public safety for all communities across Canada. It was developed with a team of industry leaders in the field of wellness, mental health, incident response, de-escalation\u00a0and veteran support.\n\nMilitary veterans often experience unique barriers related to their experiences in the military including physical and mental health problems, challenges integrating into civilian life, difficulty asking for and receiving supports.\u00a0 At times these challenges can result in a lack of employment, difficulties with relationships, addictions, homelessness and suicidal ideations.\n\nThe Military Veterans Wellness Program provides law enforcement members with an understanding of:\n\n- the Canadian Armed Forces\n\n- challenges a veteran may face during transition to civilian life\n\n- specific de-escalation techniques for a veteran in crisis\n\n- social services available to veterans\n\n- how to refer a veteran to help\n\n\nThis program will empower law enforcement members to provide a veteran the support services they need to improve their daily struggles and help put a stop to veteran homelessness and suicide.\n\n#### How the Program Works:\n\nLaw enforcement members will complete the self-guided training program, which will provide them an increased understanding of the military veteran culture and the services available for support.\n\nDuring the police officers\u2019 daily duties, they may encounter a person who they believe is a veteran. If they also have concerns that the individual is at-risk or vulnerable to crisis, harms, and/or victimization they will inquire: \u201cHave you served in the military?\u201d\n\nIf the Veteran answers yes, then the law enforcement member will educate the veteran on the existence and objectives of the Military Veterans Wellness Program. At that time, the law enforcement member will request consent from the veteran to make a referral on their behalf to three national leaders in Veteran wellness:\u00a0Veterans Affairs Canada (VAC), The Royal Canadian Legion (RCL) and the Operational Stress Injury Social Support (OSISS).\u00a0 These partners will attempt to reach out and make contact with the veteran within 72 hours to offer support.\n\nTraining is provided via the Canadian Police Knowledge Network. [Click\u00a0here to learn more or register for training](http://sworn%20police,%20police%20services,%20government%20and%20other%20first%20responders,%20student,%20private%20security/).\n\n#### National Expansion\n\nThe Military Veterans Wellness Program was created so that any law enforcement service in Canada can quickly implement it into their service.\u00a0 The program is available in both official languages and a complete program implementation package is available for you by contacting [TPSVeteranWellness@tps.ca](mailto:TPSVeteranWellness@TorontoPolice.on.ca)\n\n#### Partners:\n\n##### VETERANS AFFAIRS CANADA (VAC)\n\nVAC\u00a0is the department within the Government of Canada that is responsible for supporting the well-being of veterans (including members and former members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police) and their families. VAC provides them with client-centered services and benefits in recognition of their services to Canada. VAC is also responsible for promoting recognition and remembrance of their achievements and sacrifices in times of war, military conflict and peace.\n\n##### THE ROYAL CANADIAN LEGION (RCL)\n\nThe Royal Canadian Legion is the largest veteran not-for-profit organization in Canada. The RCL will assist and advocate for anyone who has served in the Canadian Armed Forces, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, wartime allies, Commonwealth or any peace officer who has deployed to a special duty area or international operation including their families.\n\nRCL volunteers and service representatives provide \u201con the ground\u201d support to veterans, which may include advocacy, first, and last month\u2019s rent, food vouchers, furniture, an apartment kit, a comfort bag and moving expenses.\n\nRCL can provide mentorship and a positive community for veterans and assist them with their transition back to civilian life. They contribute to research and advocacy for the larger veteran issues in Canada.\n\n##### Operational Stress Injury Social Suppport (OSISS)\n\nThe OSISS program is a national peer support program for Canadian Armed Forces members, veterans,\u00a0and their families in multiple locations across Canada who provide, mentorship, first-hand lived experience, and practical knowledge of what life is like with an OSI. OSISS is a partnership program between the Department of National Defense and Veterans Affairs Canada.\u00a0 Confidentiality is the cornerstone of OSISS and we are bound by professional ethics in regards to what and who we can share information with. Our services can be a\u00a0compliment to other mental health and family support services. Because we are peers (someone with a similar experience) we are non-judgemental and can walk alongside you in your journey.\n\n#### Learn More:\n\nWatch the [24 Shades of Blue podcast](https://youtu.be/tHYjX_sSogI)\n\nRead the [Toronto Police News story](https://www.tps.ca/media-centre/video-gallery/officers-recognized-for-assisting-veterans-in-the/)\n\nRead the [Blueline Magazine story](https://www.blueline.ca/the-police-military-veterans-wellness-program-leaving-the-streets-behind/)\n\n## Contact Military Veterans Wellness Program\n\n[tpsmilitarywellness@tps.ca](mailto:tpsmilitarywellness@tps.ca)\n\n### Constable Aaron Dale\n\n**Mobile:**\n437-990-5338\n\nSend an email\n\n### Acting Staff Sergeant Brian Smith  Risk Intervention Coordinator\n\n\n\n416-808-0145\n\nSend an email\n\n### Constable Jeremy Burns\n\n**Mobile:**\n437-242-6528\n\nSend an email\n\nClose\n\n## Send your message\n\nName:\n\nEmail:\n\nMessage:\n\nCaptcha:\n\n[iframe](cid:frame-B4E5FA8C1AFDEAC26A3CF99901E7D364@mhtml.blink)\n\n## Submit Questions to the Military Veterans Wellness Program\n\nName:\n\nEmail:\n\nMessage:\n\nCaptcha:\n\n[iframe](cid:frame-EE0F2C22DE098AF098CC2DBF273CA687@mhtml.blink)\n\n### Share\n\nShare\n(opens in new window) Tweet\n(opens in new window) Email\n(opens in new window)\n\nLinkedIn\n(opens in new window) Reddit\n(opens in new window) Copy URL",

The LTAC also manages the Kids Cops & Computers Program.\n\n#### Lockdowns\n\n- The officer is fully trained as the Lockdown coordinator. The topics (lockdown, shelter in place, hold and secure and bomb threats) were first introduced in the Police/School Protocol. The officer visits schools and delivers lockdown presentations to school staff and assists with lockdown drills throughout the school year. There are over 700 schools with the TDSB and TCDSB.\n- The Lockdown training has expanded to Private Schools, Jewish Schools, Islamic Schools, Turkish Schools, Adult Schools, in the Post-Secondary and Secondary boards. The training is also given to Colleges, Universities, Community Centres, Hospitals, Day Cares, Malls, Corporations (as a result of Community engagement) , Toronto Police College \u2013 Youth Investigators Course, CMU Course, Local divisions on Parade, Toronto Police Head Quarters \u2013 Entire building, and during the Sunday morning Active Attacker scenario\u2019s.\n\n#### Threat Assessment\n\n- Recent events such as high-profile college and school shootings, terrorist attacks and other traumatic events have created a new culture of concern for Police, students and staff safety. In past cases of school violence, many administrators, police officers, educators, mental health professionals, families and peers had some knowledge prior to the incident. If the information had been shared, a clearer picture of the evolutionary pathway towards violence may have emerged.\n- The officer\u2019s role as the Threat Assessment Coordinator is to work with the school boards as the services contact person to ensure proper Police representation during a Threat Assessment. The Officer also Co trains Police Officers, Teachers, Principals, and other school administrators with the TCDSB & TDSB Safe school Advisors. The training course is a full day and the participant receives a certificate once they have completed the training.\n\n## Contact Threat Assessment\n\n416-808-0137\n\n40 College St, Toronto, ON\n\nM5G 2J3\n\n\n\n![Location of the contact address on the map](/static/images/maps/40_college.jpg)\n\n### Share\n\nShare\n(opens in new window) Tweet\n(opens in new window) Email\n(opens in new window)\n\nLinkedIn\n(opens in new window) Reddit\n(opens in new window) Copy URL",

Of the 91 recommendations made, 90, including all 11 that named the Toronto Police Service (TPS) as the lead have been implemented.\n\nOn the heels of this remarkable success, a second set of recommendations \u2013 dubbed Toronto Senior Strategy 2.0, was drafted and subsequently adopted by City Council in 2018. TPS and its partners are actively engaged in the implementation of these 25 most recent recommendations. Implementation of these recommendations fall under the portfolio of TPS\u2019 Vulnerable Persons Coordinator (VPC).

Having this YPDP centralized in Toronto allows the Toronto Police Service to deliver a standard centralized program that is designed to benefit all of Toronto youth equally. In cooperation with our partners at the Ministry of Children, Community and Social Services (MCCSS), youth involved in the YPDP are referred to programs within the community where they reside.\n\nThe goals of the YPDP align with the goals set out in the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA)\n\n- They enable early intervention with youth\n\n- They make it possible for the community at large to play an important role in the development of community-based responses to youth crime\n\n- They increased use of non-judicial interventions\n\n- They improve the response to less serious youth crime\n\n- They enable the courts to focus on more serious criminal cases\n\n\n### Detective Shane Miller  Diversion Coordinator\n\n\n\n416-808-0129\n\nSend an email\n\n### Constable Lauren Vanspall  Diversion Coordinator\n\n\n\n416-808-0174\n\nSend an email\n\nClose\n\n## Send your message\n\nName:\n\nEmail:\n\nMessage:\n\nCaptcha:\n\n## Contact Community Partnerships and Engagement Unit\n\n416-808-0100\n\n40 College St., Toronto ON\n\nM5G 2J3\n\n\n\n![Location of the contact address on the map](/static/images/maps/40_college.jpg)",

On these occasion officers attended designated locations to meet with community members and provided information in a formal and informal manner, educating newcomers on possible interactions with police officers and navigating the criminal justice system.\n\nOur three main sources of interaction with the community have been facilitated by the City of Toronto Syrian Refugee resettlement Program, YWCA of Toronto and the Levant Settlement Centre.\n\nThe team has also engaged through ongoing partnerships and protocols with numerous school boards, community agencies, government agencies and other stakeholders.\n\n#### Pro-Action Cops and Kids\n\nMembers continue to support ProAction Cops and Kids by assisting divisional members with advice and completing applications for submission and consideration.

Over time, it became clear that the police did not understand the historical and cultural barriers that prevented Aboriginal people from interacting more positively with police. The result was that Aboriginal community members did not benefit from the full range of police services routinely available to the community at large.\n\nIn 1989, an Aboriginal officer with extensive professional and volunteer involvement with his community was assigned to support the Aboriginal community on a full-time basis. The role evolved and expanded and in September 1992, the Toronto Police Services Board approved the establishment of the Aboriginal Peacekeeping Unit (APU). The Toronto Police Service became the first major urban police service in Canada to establish a unit to deal specifically with the issues faced by the Aboriginal community.\n\nOver the years, members of the unit have established a rapport with the community and have dispelled much of the negativism which had existed previously. Through formal and casual contact with community members, Aboriginal Peacekeeping Unit officers have worked diligently to gain the trust of the community. The result of this outreach is a two-way educational process by which the community learns about policing services and officers become better informed on Aboriginal customs, traditions, values, historic events, and modes of behaviour.\n\nThe Aboriginal Liaison Officer ensures that lines of open communications are established and maintained between the police and community agencies and attends meetings, seminars and workshops to provide consultation and education on police procedures, the role of the police, individual rights and other legal issues.\n\nA constructive dialogue and information-sharing process exists with other police services serving the Aboriginal communities in Ontario and across Canada. The Service also maintains an Aboriginal Community Consultative Committee. Members of the community who sit on the committee work with a Staff Superintendent and a member of the Aboriginal Peacekeeping Unit to discuss issues of mutual concern in an atmosphere of trust and understanding.\n\n## Resources\n\n### Hate the Hate -- Report the Crime\n\n[Download File](/files/download/1652806519/43125/)\n\nPlease note that some documents might not render correctly in your browser.\nFor best experience, download/save the document to your desktop first.\n\n\n### Constable Richard Warman  Aboriginal Community Liaison\n\n\n\n416-808-7280\n\nSend an email\n\nClose\n\n## Send your message\n\nName:\n\nEmail:\n\nMessage:\n\nCaptcha:\n\n## Contact Aboriginal Peacekeeping Unit\n\n416-808-7046\n\n40 College St., Toronto, ON\n\nM5G 2J3\n\n\n\n![Location of the contact address on the map](/static/images/maps/40_college.jpg)",

The model brings together the most appropriate community agencies through weekly situation tables to provide a focused, wrap-around, risk-mitigation approach to help the most vulnerable individuals and families who are at Acutely Elevated Risk (AER) due to complex crises, potential harm, and/or victimization. There are six geographically based situation tables across the city.\n\nFOCUS is not an entity or \u2018brick and mortar\u2019 organization but a systems-focused collaboration. \u00a0If a participating FOCUS Agency partner, has a client (individual, family, neighbourhood etc..) that they feel meets the threshold of \u2018Acutely Elevated Risk (AER)\u2019, (i.e. the situation overwhelms their ability and/or mandate to help or they believe further crisis, harm, victimization\u00a0will result.) then that agency or the Toronto Police is supported in bringing that situation forward to their local FOCUS table to determine if their recommendation meets the criteria for AER and the coordinated response required to minimized harm. Once the cross-sector table confirms that the recommendation meets the AER criteria, the FOCUS Table response is a multi-agency, coordinated, team approach, providing the individual/family/neighbourhood with the supports that they need to minimize harm and establish greater stability.\n\n**What is Acutely Elevated Risk?**\n\nAcutely Elevated Risk refers to situations where imminent harm is present. Without immediate intervention, these situations will escalate and a negative outcome such as complex crises, potential harm, criminalization, and/or victimization is likely to occur.\n\n**FOCUS Situation Tables:**\n\nThe purpose of the Situation Table is to bring together diverse service providers to identify situations of Acutely Elevated Risk and prevent negative outcomes from occurring. Service providers rapidly respond and offer wraparound services to individuals with diverse needs who find themselves at risk of complex crises, potential harm, and/or victimization.\n\n**How it Works:**\n\nBy bringing together diverse sectors (e.g. mental health, addictions, criminal justice, social services, youth and family services, developmental services, etc.), the Situation Table collaboratively resolves situations of Acutely Elevated Risk. Individuals in complex situations, facing multiple risk factors that cannot be addressed by any single agency on its own, are presented. The most appropriate service provider then takes the lead and interventions are planned. The response is a multi-agency, coordinated, team approach within 24 to 48 hours, providing the individual/family/neighbourhood with the supports that they need to minimize harm and establish greater stability.\n\n**Enhancing Community Safety and Well-Being across Toronto:**\n\nEach year, FOCUS Toronto receives a wide variety of situations from partner agencies and police. These Acutely Elevated Risk (AER) situations encompass five to six unique risk factors on average. The risks range from mental health and addictions to human trafficking and gender based violence. Through referrals by partnering agencies and police, the work of FOCUS Toronto essentially intervenes in a variety of complex AER situations that span many community safety and well-being concerns. These collaborative, multi-sectoral and risk driven interventions are possible because FOCUS Toronto has over 155 partner organizations with unique mandates, programs, and capacities designed to help individuals and families across the spectrum risk factors. Since its inception in 2013, \u00a0FOCUS has consulted on thousands of unique situations.\n\n**Evolving FOCUS partnerships to address new areas of Community Safety and Well-Being:**\n\nHistorically, one area of community safety and well-being in Toronto and Canada that had limited prevention and intervention capacity is the area of preventing Ideologically Motivated Violent Extremism (IMVE), also referred to as Preventing/Countering Violent Extremism (P/CVE).\n\nThis is an area often closely intertwined with hate crimes. Recognizing this gap in 2014, the TPS began to work internally by striking a small project team to explore alternative capacities. In essence, creating a risk mitigation approach that could be engaged up-stream from enforcement so that criminality, crisis, harms, and victimization could be prevented.\n\nIn 2014, the TPS Community Partnerships and Engagement Unit (CPEU) partnered with TPS Intelligence Services - Security Section, Hate Crime Unit, and the Toronto Police College to find alternatives. Over the next decade, the TPS, supported by the two FOCUS Toronto co-leads (City of Toronto and the United Way Greater Toronto) worked through the FOCUS Toronto partnerships to build IMVE prevention/intervention capacities at the FOCUS Situation Tables and right across Toronto.\n\nIn 2018, the Toronto Police Service, FOCUS Toronto, and later, Yorktown Family Services (YFS) - Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) program began a partnership with [Public Safety Canada's (PSC) Canada Centre for Community Engagement and Prevention of Violence](https://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/cnt/bt/cc/index-en.aspx) to continue to strengthen Toronto\u2019s partnerships and responses. In 2021, in recognition of this successful prevention/intervention work, the Toronto based ETA program expanded their catchment area to help all communities across Southern Ontario.\n\n**Concerns about IMVE? How to access help in Toronto:**\n\nThere are now multiple pathways available across Toronto to help individuals and families. Regardless of the entry point, systems are in place through FOCUS Toronto to navigate the most appropriate risk intervention response. Accessing help can occur in a number of ways:\n\n- A criteria situation involving IMVE is brought forward to a FOCUS Table through a partner agency or police.\n- A family or individual can reach out directly to Yorktown Family Services (YFS) and their [Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA)](https://etatoronto.ca/) program.\n- Reported to or discovered by the Toronto Police Service. As required, the Community Partnerships and Engagement Unit will be engaged, and if applicable, the situation will be referred to FOCUS Toronto, ETA, or other partners.\n- Report to a Community Agency or Toronto Police and they refer directly to [ETA](https://etatoronto.ca/).\n\n**Meeting Frequency:**\n\nMeetings are held at FOCUS tables across the City. Each of the six tables meets once per week at a designated time and place.\n\n- FOCUS Downtown West (11, 14, 52 Divisions)\n- FOCUS Downtown East (51 Division)\n- FOCUS Rexdale (22, 23 Divisions)\n- FOCUS Scarborough (41, 42, 43 Divisions)\n- FOCUS Black Creek (31, 32 Divisions)\n- FOCUS York (12, 13 Divsiions)\n\n![Map of Toronto with FOCUS table zones (noted above)](/media/filer_public_thumbnails/filer_public/6e/5d/6e5d9ed0-8f0c-45d0-847a-c34516fd047c/focus_toronto_situation_tables_map_nov_2023.jpg__1600x1131_q85_subject_location-546%2C411_subsampling-2.jpg)\n\n## Resources\n\n### Community Partnership Award 2020/21: Toronto Police Service\n\n[Open Link](https://www.yorktownfamilyservices.com/blogposts/2020-21-community-partnership-award-toronto-police-service-focusing-on-success/)\n\n### FOCUS Presentation to Toronto Police Services Board\n\n[Download File](/files/download/1651533154/42709/)\n\n### FOCUS Toronto Star Article\n\n[Download File](/files/download/1651526528/42708/)\n\n### Sixth FOCUS Table Launches\n\n[Open Link](https://www.tps.ca/media-centre/stories/sixth-focus-table-launches/)\n\nPlease note that some documents might not render correctly in your browser.\nFor best experience, download/save the document to your desktop first.\n\n\n[VIEW ALL](/services/resource-centre/)\n\nClose\n\n## Send your message\n\nName:\n\nEmail:\n\nMessage:\n\nCaptcha:\n\n## Contact FOCUS Toronto\n\n416-808-0100\n\n[\\[email\u00a0protected\\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#fdbbb2bea8aea9928f92938992bd898d8ed39e9c)\n\n### Key Contacts\n\nF.O.C.U.S Toronto is jointly managed by the United Way Greater Toronto (UWGT), Toronto Police Service (TPS), and the City of Toronto (CoT).

The program was developed to create awareness within our community of the challenges of policing our diverse city in the 1990's. The program was cancelled in 2006.\n\nIn partnership with Humber College, the Community Police Academy was re-launched on October 22, 2016 at the request of Chief Mark Saunders and Deputy Chief Peter Yuen.\u00a0The Service\u2019s Police and Community Engagement Review (PACER) and the Transformational Task Force (TTF) both recognized the need to educate the public and enhance information-sharing with the community in order to forge better relationships. The creation of the Community Police Academy addresses the suggestions made in the PACER Report and clearly illustrates the Service\u2019s commitment to the TTF principles of an Actively Accountable and Trusted, Transparent and Engaged and Inclusive and Collaborative Police Service.\n\nThe goals and objectives for the Community Police Academy:\n\n- To reinforce the Service\u2019s commitment to the PACER recommendations and TTF principles\n- To foster enhanced community/police partnerships by creating an environment of increased trust, cooperation, and collaboration between the community and the police through education\n- Provide an opportunity for interested community members to better understand the role of modern policing in Toronto\n- Have a better understanding of the policies and laws that guide the decision making of officers and police practices through in-class and scenario based training\n- Have an appreciation for the complexities of policing a large city and the daily operations of the Toronto Police Service\n\nThis nine-week course will teach you all about policing in Toronto. \u00a0From our rich history, to neighbourhood policing, to crime scene management, to how we investigate violent crimes, the lessons will give you deeper knowledge into how, and why, we do the things we do.\n\nTaught by subject matter experts at the Service, students will also gain a better understanding of how they can partner with us to keep our communities safe.\n\nThe Academy is free to anyone 16 years of age and older who lives, works, or volunteers in the city of Toronto. \u00a0Students must attend every week in order to graduate; exceptions will only be made under exigent circumstances.\n\nHosted by the Toronto Police College, located at 70 Birmingham Street\u00a0in south Etobicoke, this best-in-class training facility will offer in-class lectures and discussions as well as practical exercises.\n\nThe Toronto Police Service has partnered with Humber College to offer credits upon successful completion of the Community Police Academy. Graduates will be recognized by Chief Mark Saunders and will be eligible for exemption from one course (3 credits) in Humber\u2019s Police Foundations Diploma.\n\nIn order to apply for a transfer credit, students need to be aware of the following:\n\n- The Community Police Academy Graduate must secure themselves a Humber College Student number if they do not already have one. Please call 416-675-5005.\n- The student must fill in a\u00a0[Prior Learning Assessment and Recognition Application (PLAR)](http://registrar.humberc.on.ca/ride2011/doc/PLARApplication.pdf).\n- Applicants must be 18+.\n- The Humber course code to be used on the Prior Learning Assessment and Recognition Application (PLAR) is\u00a0**PFP 204- Community Policing**.\n- The student must attach copies of the Certificate of Completion signed and issued by the TPS.\n- The student must also include the Course Training Standard Syllabus with their application.\n- The application must be submitted to the Registrar\u2019s office for processing.\n- There is a fee associated with transfer credits.

While many of the 151 recommendations suggest systemic changes relating to missing person investigations, one recommendation indicated that the Service should conduct Missing Person Awareness Days.\n\nSo, February 3, 2024 marks the inaugural Toronto Police Service Missing Person Awareness Day. February 3 was chosen in consultation with our Missing and Missed Implementation Community Representatives, in part, because it coincides with National Missing Person Day, which is held on February 3 each year in the United States.\n\n##### Guide to Missing Person Reporting\n\nThis guide designed to empower our community with valuable information on the process of reporting missing persons, offering guidance on assisting in their location, dispelling common myths, and providing additional resources.\n\n##### **The Missing Persons Unit**\n\nThe Missing Persons Unit oversees missing persons cases and unidentified human remains occurrences from all over the city of Toronto.

In less urgent situations, please contact the non-emergency number: 416-808-2222.\n\n- Investigators will not close the missing person\u2019s file until they have verified the location and identity of the missing person.\n\n\n##### How to Report Someone Missing\n\nAs soon as you can't find someone and are concerned for their safety, report them missing. Here are ways to report:\n\n- Call 9-1-1 if concerned about immediate safety\n\n- Call the non-emergency line 416-808-2222\n\n- Attend a police station\n\n\n##### How to Assist in Locating a Missing Person\n\n- **Family and Friends**: Ensure they haven't made other arrangements.\n\n- **Local Hospitals**: Verify with healthcare institutions.\n\n- **School/Employer**: Contact educational institutions or employers.\n\n- **Frequented Places**: Check places the person usually goes.\n\n- **Social Media**: Monitor accounts for activity.\n\n- **Update the police with new information**.
