main_v2.py
PURPOSE: This script generates a safety plan for a given neighbourhood and crime concerns, using a LLM and a vector database.

CHANGES: 
* Enhanced LangSmith tracing to show complete formatted safety plan in traces, will be used to make evaluation sets.
* Prompt engineering for the analysis chain, to improve context recall and faithfulness.
* Provided a good one-shot example from Trinity-Bellwoods, to help the LLM understand the style and tone expected from the safety plan.
