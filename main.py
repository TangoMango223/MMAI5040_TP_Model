    CITY OF TORONTO SERVICE SAFETY PLAN
    Neighbourhood: Agincourt North (129)
    Primary Concerns: Assault: Low, Auto Theft: Medium, Break and Enter: Low, Robbery: Medium

    1. NEIGHBOURHOOD-SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT:

    Agincourt North is generally a safe neighbourhood with low levels of assault and break and enter incidents. However, there are medium levels of auto theft and robbery. It's important to be vigilant, especially during late hours and in less crowded areas. Parking lots and streets with less foot traffic may be hotspots for auto theft. 

    2. TARGETED SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS:

    - Assault and Break and Enter: Although these crimes are low in your area, it's important to stay vigilant. Keep your home well-lit, especially around entrances and exits. Install a peephole or doorbell camera to monitor who approaches your home. If you notice any suspicious activity, report it to the police immediately.

    - Auto Theft and Robbery: Always lock your car doors and keep windows rolled up. Check inside your car before entering, including the back seat. If you notice anyone loitering around parking areas, report it to the police. 

    3. PERSONAL SAFETY PROTOCOL:

    Develop daily safety habits such as locking all doors and windows when leaving home, and keeping your car keys ready when walking to your vehicle. Keep a list of emergency contacts in your phone and a physical copy at home. In case of an emergency, call 9-1-1. For non-emergencies, call the Toronto Police at 416-808-2222. 

    4. PREVENTIVE MEASURES:

    Enhance your home security by installing a security system and outdoor lighting. Consider using personal safety technology such as a personal alarm or a safety app on your phone. Engage with your community through neighbourhood watch programs. Report any suspicious activity to the police and keep their non-emergency number handy: 416-808-2222.

    Remember, your safety is a priority. Stay vigilant, be aware of your surroundings, and don't hesitate to report any suspicious activity. The Toronto Police Service is here to help and support you.
