            CITY OF TORONTO SERVICE SAFETY PLAN
            Neighbourhood: York University Heights (27)
            Primary Concerns: Robbery: low, Break and Enter: high

            1. NEIGHBOURHOOD-SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT:

York University Heights has a high rate of break and enter incidents. This may be influenced by its proximity to York University, as areas near universities can sometimes be targeted due to the transient nature of student populations and the likelihood of unoccupied residences during school breaks. It is recommended to be extra cautious during school breaks and at times when your home is unattended for extended periods.

2. TARGETED SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS:

For Break and Enter:
- Prevention Strategies: Enhance your existing alarm system with additional features such as window sensors or motion detectors. Install security cameras. Use timers to turn lights on and off at various intervals to make your home appear occupied even when it's not.
- Warning Signs: Unusual activity in your neighbourhood, such as unfamiliar vehicles or individuals loitering.
- Immediate Actions: If you suspect a break-in, do not enter your home. Call 911 immediately.
- Community Resources: The Toronto Police and City of Toronto provide resources and recommendations for improving home security. Contact your local city councillor or the Toronto Police directly to lobby for more frequent police patrols.

3. PERSONAL SAFETY PROTOCOL:

- Daily Safety Habits: Be vigilant and aware of your surroundings. Report any suspicious activity to the police.
- Essential Safety Tools: Consider installing a more advanced alarm system and security cameras. Use a Trace Identified pen to mark your valuables.
- Emergency Contact Information: Toronto Police Service non-emergency line: 416-808-2222. In case of emergency, dial 911.
- Community Support Services: Get to know your neighbours and consider forming or joining a neighbourhood watch program.

4. PREVENTIVE MEASURES:

- Home/Property Security: Secure sliding doors with commercially available bars or locks, or use a wooden dowel or broom handle in the door track. Report burnt out lights on your property.
- Personal Safety Technology: Consider installing a more advanced alarm system and security cameras.
- Community Engagement Opportunities: Get to know your neighbours and consider forming or joining a neighbourhood watch program.
- Reporting Procedures: Report any suspicious activity to the Toronto Police Service non-emergency line: 416-808-2222. In case of emergency, dial 911.

Please note that while these recommendations are based on the information provided, it is always a good idea to contact the Toronto Police Service's non-emergency line for more specific guidance. Stay safe and vigilant.

            Primary Concerns: Robbery: low, Assault: high

            1. NEIGHBOURHOOD-SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT:

Rosedale-Moore Park is currently experiencing a high level of assaults, which is a significant concern for residents and visitors. The risk of assault appears to be perceived as higher during nighttime hours, particularly in areas with poor lighting or isolated locations. As you visit this area several times a week for work, your exposure to these risks may be increased.

- Warning Signs: Be alert for suspicious behavior or individuals who seem out of place. Trust your instincts; if something doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. 
- Immediate Actions: If you feel threatened, move to a populated area and call 911. If an assault occurs, try to remember as many details as possible about the assailant and report the incident to the police immediately. 
- Community Resources: The Toronto Police Service offers a variety of resources, including Crime Stoppers for anonymous reporting of crimes. 

3. PERSONAL SAFETY PROTOCOL:

- Daily Safety Habits: Stay alert and aware of your surroundings. Avoid walking alone at night in isolated or poorly lit areas. 
- Essential Safety Tools: Consider carrying a personal alarm or whistle. Download the Toronto Police Service Mobile App for easy access to safety resources and reporting tools. 
- Emergency Contact Information: Program the Toronto Police Service non-emergency number (416-808-2222) into your phone. In an emergency, call 911. 
- Community Support Services: Reach out to local community organizations for support and resources. 

4. PREVENTIVE MEASURES:

- Home/Property Security: Ensure your home or workplace is secure, with adequate lighting and secure locks. Consider installing a security system or cameras. 
- Personal Safety Technology: Consider using a personal safety app, such as the Toronto Police Service Mobile App, which provides access to safety resources and reporting tools. 
- Community Engagement: Participate in local community safety initiatives or neighborhood watch programs. 
- Reporting Procedures: Report any suspicious activity to the Toronto Police Service via their non-emergency number or Crime Stoppers. 

Remember, your safety is paramount. By staying alert, being aware of your surroundings, and taking proactive steps to enhance your safety, you can help to mitigate the risk of assault.

Malvern East (146) has a high incidence of break and enter crimes and assaults. These crimes are often opportunistic, occurring when homes appear unoccupied or when individuals are isolated. The risk is particularly high during nighttime due to reduced visibility and less foot traffic. The recent assault near your residence has understandably heightened your concerns.

- Immediate Actions: If you feel threatened, move to a public place and call 911. 
- Community Resources: The Toronto Police Service offers personal safety workshops and has resources on their website.

3. PERSONAL SAFETY PROTOCOL:

- Essential Safety Tools: Consider carrying a personal alarm or whistle. Keep your phone charged and accessible. 
- Emergency Contact Information: Save the Toronto Police Service non-emergency number (416-808-2222) in your phone. In case of emergency, call 911. 
- Community Support Services: Reach out to local community centres or neighbourhood associations for support and resources.

4. PREVENTIVE MEASURES:

- Home/Property Security: Install motion-sensitive lights and alter fencing to increase visibility. Consider installing a security system or video doorbell. 
- Personal Safety Technology: Consider using safety apps that can share your location with trusted contacts or alert them if you're in danger. 
- Community Engagement: Participate in or start a neighbourhood watch program. This can help increase vigilance and deter crime. 
- Reporting Procedures: Report any suspicious activity to the Toronto Police Service non-emergency line (416-808-2222). In case of emergency, call 911.

            CITY OF TORONTO SERVICE SAFETY PLAN
            Neighbourhood: Etobicoke City Centre (159)
            Primary Concerns: Auto Theft: low, Robbery: medium, Assault: high, Break and Enter: low

            1. NEIGHBOURHOOD-SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT:

Etobicoke City Centre has a high level of assault and a medium level of robbery, with lower levels of auto theft and break and enter. The area is most active between 9 AM and 9 PM due to local businesses' operating hours. The presence of an active neighborhood watch program and regular community meetings indicates a community engaged in its own safety. However, the high level of assault suggests that more proactive measures may be needed. Residents should be particularly cautious during late hours when businesses are closed and in areas with less foot traffic.

2. TARGETED SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS:

- Assault: Prevention strategies include traveling in groups, especially during late hours, and staying in well-lit, populated areas. Warning signs could include suspicious individuals or groups, particularly if they appear to be following you. If you encounter a potential assault situation, try to remove yourself from the situation and call 911 immediately. The Toronto Community Crisis Service and Community Crisis Response Program are available resources.

- Robbery: Prevention strategies include being aware of your surroundings, not displaying valuable items in public, and avoiding isolated areas. Warning signs could include individuals loitering or behaving suspiciously. If you encounter a robbery, comply with the robber's demands and call 911 as soon as it is safe to do so. The Toronto Police Service can provide support and assistance.

- Auto Theft and Break and Enter: Prevention strategies include locking your vehicle/home at all times, installing security systems, and not leaving valuable items in plain sight. Warning signs could include suspicious individuals loitering near your property. If you encounter these crimes, call 911 immediately. The Toronto Police Service and your neighborhood watch program are available resources.

3. PERSONAL SAFETY PROTOCOL:

Develop daily safety habits such as checking your surroundings before entering or exiting your vehicle/home, and informing someone of your whereabouts if you plan to be out late. Essential safety tools could include a personal alarm and a fully charged mobile phone. In case of emergency, call 911. Community support services include the Toronto Community Crisis Service and Community Crisis Response Program.

4. PREVENTIVE MEASURES:

For home/property security, consider installing security cameras and motion sensor lights. Personal safety technology suggestions include a personal alarm and a mobile safety app. Engage with your community by attending neighborhood watch meetings and community meetings. Report any suspicious activity to the Toronto Police Service's non-emergency line at 416-808-2222.

Remember, these are general recommendations. For more specific guidance, please contact the Toronto Police Service's non-emergency line. Stay safe and vigilant.

            Neighbourhood: St.Andrew-Windfields (40)
            Primary Concerns: Break and Enter: high

            1. NEIGHBOURHOOD-SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT:

The St. Andrew-Windfields area has been experiencing a high rate of break-ins, particularly during nighttime hours. This suggests that the risk is higher during these hours due to factors such as reduced visibility and fewer people being awake and active. The recent break-in experienced by your neighbour further highlights the need for increased vigilance and safety measures. 

2. TARGETED SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS:

For Break and Enter:

Prevention Strategies:
- Enhance visibility around your property by installing motion sensor lights.
- Use window security measures such as bars or locks, especially for ground floor and balcony windows.
- Consider a security system with a loud alarm to scare off intruders and alert neighbours.
- Join or start a neighbourhood watch program to increase surveillance during nighttime hours.
- Keep the exterior of your property well-lit and free of hiding places for burglars, such as overgrown vegetation.
- Use timers to turn on lights, radios, or TVs when not at home to give the impression that someone is home.

Warning Signs:
- Unfamiliar vehicles or individuals loitering in the neighbourhood.
- Signs of forced entry such as broken windows or damaged doors.
- Unusual noises during the night.

Immediate Actions:
- If you suspect a break-in, do not enter your home. Call 911 immediately.
- If you notice suspicious activity, report it to the Toronto Police Service's non-emergency line at 416-808-2222.

            CITY OF TORONTO SERVICE SAFETY PLAN
            Neighbourhood: Downtown Yonge East (168)
            Primary Concerns: Break and Enter: low, Robbery: medium, Assault: high, Auto Theft: medium

            1. NEIGHBOURHOOD-SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT:

Downtown Yonge East (168) has been identified as an area with high levels of assault, medium levels of robbery and auto theft. These crimes can often be interrelated, and areas with high levels of one type of crime can attract other types of crime due to perceived lawlessness or lack of security. Environmental factors such as poor lighting, limited natural surveillance, or high levels of vacant or underused spaces can attract criminal activity. Seasonal and daily variations can also affect crime rates, with higher risks during warmer months and late hours. 

2. TARGETED SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS:

- Assault: 
    - Prevention Strategies: Avoid walking alone at night, especially in poorly lit or secluded areas. Consider attending a self-defense course or carrying a personal alarm.
    - Warning Signs: Be aware of your surroundings and watch for suspicious behaviour.
    - Immediate Actions: If you feel threatened, move to a populated area and call 911.
    - Community Resources: Toronto Police Service offers personal safety workshops. 

- Robbery:
    - Prevention Strategies: Keep valuables out of sight and avoid displaying expensive items in public. 
    - Warning Signs: Be alert for individuals following you or acting suspiciously.
    - Immediate Actions: If confronted, prioritize your safety over possessions. Report the incident to the police as soon as possible.
    - Community Resources: The Toronto Police Service offers robbery prevention tips on their website.

- Auto Theft:
    - Prevention Strategies: Always lock your vehicle, park in well-lit and busy areas, and do not leave valuables in your vehicle.
    - Warning Signs: Be aware of suspicious individuals or activities around parking areas.
    - Immediate Actions: If your vehicle is stolen, report it to the police immediately.
    - Community Resources: The Toronto Police Service provides auto theft prevention tips on their website.

3. PERSONAL SAFETY PROTOCOL:

- Daily Safety Habits: Stay alert and aware of your surroundings, especially during late hours. Avoid walking alone at night.
- Essential Safety Tools: Consider carrying a personal alarm and installing a safety app on your phone.
- Emergency Contact Information: Keep the Toronto Police Service's non-emergency line (416-808-2222) and emergency line (911) saved in your phone.
- Community Support Services: Participate in community safety initiatives such as neighbourhood watch programs.

4. PREVENTIVE MEASURES:

- Home/Property Security: Continue using security cameras and consider reinforcing doors and windows, installing a peephole or door viewer, and ensuring that your security cameras cover all entrances.
- Personal Safety Technology: Consider using a safety app that can alert authorities or trusted contacts in case of emergency.
- Community Engagement: Participate in community safety initiatives, such as neighbourhood watch programs, community policing, or crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED) projects.
- Reporting Procedures: Report any suspicious activities or crimes to the Toronto Police Service's non-emergency line (416-808-2222) or in case of immediate danger, call 911.

Remember, while these safety concerns are serious, there are practical and accessible strategies that you can implement to improve your safety and quality of life. Stay vigilant, stay safe.
