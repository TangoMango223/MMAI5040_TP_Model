# Improvements done:
* Gave LLM a one-shot example of a prompt that scored high on all 4 metrics, especially context_recall (over 80%)
* prompt-engineering for first prompt, which is brainstorming and retreival, since that is where the issue is
* faithfulness also needed improvement, it is also tied to context recall
* context recall - if the most relevant documents are not retrieved, the LLM will not be able to make a good analysis -> might encourage hallucinations
